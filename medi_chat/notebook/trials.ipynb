He had major interests in rheumatology and medical education. \\nMedical students who attended his clinical teaching sessions remember him as \\nan inspirational teacher with the ability to present complex problems with great \\nclarity. He was invariably courteous to his patients and students alike. He had an \\nuncanny knack of involving all students equally in clinical discussions and used \\npraise rather than criticism. He paid great attention to the value of history taking \\nand, from this, expected students to identify what particular aspects of the physical \\nexamination should help to narrow the diagnostic options.\\nHis consultant colleagues at the Western welcomed the opportunity of contributing \\nwhen he suggested writing a textbook on clinical examination. The book was first \\npublished in 1964 and John Macleod edited seven editions. With characteristic \\nmodesty he was very embarrassed when the eighth edition was renamed Macleod’s \\nClinical Examination. This, however, was a small way of recognising his enormous \\ncontribution to medical education.\\nHe possessed the essential quality of a successful editor – the skill of changing \\ndisparate contributions from individual contributors into a uniform style and format \\nwithout causing offence; everybody accepted his authority. He avoided being \\ndogmatic or condescending. He was generous in teaching others his editorial \\nskills and these attributes were recognised when he was invited to edit Davidson’s \\nPrinciples and Practice of Medicine .'),\n",

These time-honoured \\nskills can often allow clinicians to reach a clear diagnosis without \\nrecourse to expensive and potentially harmful tests.\\nThis book aims to assist clinicians in developing the consultation \\nskills required to elicit a clear history, and the practical skills \\nneeded to detect clinical signs of disease. Where possible, the \\nphysical basis of clinical signs is explained to aid understanding. \\nFormulation of a differential diagnosis from the information gained \\nis introduced, and the logical initial investigations are included for \\neach system. Macleod’s Clinical Examination is designed to be \\nused in conjunction with more detailed texts on pathophysiology, \\ndifferential diagnosis and clinical medicine, illustrating specifically \\nhow the history and examination can inform the diagnostic \\nprocess.\\nIn this edition the contents have been restructured and the \\ntext comprehensively updated by a team of existing and new \\nauthors, with the aim of creating an accessible and user-friendly \\ntext relevant to the practice of medicine in the 21st century.\\nSection 1 addresses the general principles of good interaction \\nwith patients, from the basics of taking a history and examining, \\nto the use of pattern recognition to identify spot diagnoses. \\nSection 2 deals with symptoms and signs in specific systems \\nand Section 3 illustrates the application of these skills to specific \\nclinical situations. Section 4 covers preparation for assessments \\nof clinical skills and for the use of these skills in everyday practice.\\nAn expertly performed history and examination of a patient \\nallows the doctor to detect disease and predict prognosis, and is \\ncrucial to the principle of making the patient and their concerns \\ncentral to the care process, and also to the avoidance of harm \\nfrom unnecessary or unjustified tests.\\nWe hope that if young clinicians are encouraged to adopt \\nand adapt these skills, they not only will serve their patients \\nas diagnosticians but also will themselves continue to develop \\nclinical examination techniques and a better understanding of \\ntheir mechanisms and diagnostic use.\\nThe 14th edition of Macleod’s Clinical Examination  has an \\naccompanying set of videos available in the online Student \\nConsult electronic library. This book is closely integrated with \\nDavidson’s Principles and Practice of Medicine and is best read \\nin conjunction with that text.\\nJAI, ARD, KF\\nEdinburgh, 2018'),\n",

Examples of person-specific factors that reduce \\nthe propensity to consult include stoicism, self-reliance, guilt, \\nunwillingness to acknowledge psychological distress, and \\nembarrassment about lifestyle factors such as addictions. These \\nfactors may vary between patients and also in the same person \\nin different circumstances, and may be influenced by gender, \\neducation, social class and ethnicity.\\nThe clinical environment\\nYou should take all reasonable steps to ensure that the \\nconsultation is conducted in a calm, private environment. The \\nlayout of the consulting room is important and furniture should \\nbe arranged to put the patient at ease (Fig. 1.1A) by avoiding \\nface-to-face, confrontational positioning across a table and the \\nincursion of computer screens between patient and doctor (Fig. \\n1.1B). Personal mobile devices can also be intrusive if not used \\njudiciously.\\nFor hospital inpatients the environment is a challenge, yet \\nprivacy and dignity are always important. There may only be \\ncurtains around the bed space, which afford very little by way \\nof privacy for a conversation. If your patient is mobile, try to \\nuse a side room or interview room. If there is no alternative to \\nspeaking to patients at their bedside, let them know that you \\nunderstand your conversation may be overheard and give them \\npermission not to answer sensitive questions about which they \\nfeel uncomfortable.\\nThe clinical encounter\\nThe clinical encounter between a patient and doctor lies at the \\nheart of most medical practice. At its simplest, it is the means by \\nwhich people who are ill, or believe themselves to be ill, seek the \\nadvice of a doctor whom they trust. Traditionally, and still most \\noften, the clinical encounter is conducted face to face, although \\nnon-face-to-face or remote consultation using the telephone or \\ndigital technology is possible and increasingly common. This \\nchapter describes the general principles that underpin interactions \\nwith patients in a clinical environment.\\nReasons for the encounter\\nThe majority of people who experience symptoms of ill health \\ndo not seek professional advice. For the minority who do seek \\nhelp, the decision to consult is usually based on a complex \\ninterplay of physical, psychological and social factors (Box 1.1). \\nThe perceived seriousness of the symptoms and the severity of \\nthe illness experience are very important influences on whether \\npatients seek help. The anticipated severity of symptoms is \\ndetermined by their intensity, the patient’s familiarity with them, \\nand their duration and frequency. Beyond this, patients try to \\nmake sense of their symptoms within the context of their lives. \\nThey observe and evaluate their symptoms based on evidence \\nfrom their own experience and from information they have \\ngathered from a range of sources, including family and friends, \\nprint and broadcast media, and the internet. Patients who present \\nwith a symptom are significantly more likely to believe or worry \\nthat their symptom indicates a serious or fatal condition than \\nnon-consulters with similar symptoms; for example, a family \\nhistory of sudden death from heart disease may affect how a \\nperson interprets an episode of chest pain. Patients also weigh \\nup the relative costs (financial or other, such as inconvenience) \\nand benefits of consulting a doctor. The expectation of benefit \\nfrom a consultation – for example, in terms of symptom relief \\nor legitimisation of time off work – is a powerful predictor of \\nconsultation. There may also be times when other priorities in \\npatients’ lives are more important than their symptoms of ill health \\nand deter or delay consultation. It is important to consider the \\ntiming of the consultation. Why has the patient presented now? \\nSometimes it is not the experience of symptoms themselves that \\nprovokes consultation but something else in the patients’ lives \\nthat triggers them to seek help (Box 1.2).\\n1.1 Deciding to consult a doctor\\n• Perceived susceptibility or vulnerability to illness\\n• Perceived severity of symptoms\\n• Perceived costs of consulting\\n• Perceived benefits of consulting\\n1.2 Triggers to consultation\\n• Interpersonal crisis\\n• Interference with social or personal relations\\n• Sanctioning or pressure from family or friends\\n• Interference with work or physical activity\\n• Reaching the limit of tolerance of symptoms\\nA\\nB\\nFig. 1.1 Seating arrangements.  A  In this friendly seating arrangement \\nthe doctor sits next to the patient, at an angle.  B  Barriers to \\ncommunication are set up by an oppositional/confrontational seating \\narrangement. The desk acts as a barrier, and the doctor is distracted by \\nlooking at a computer screen that is not easily viewable by the patient.'),\n",

If the their body language becomes \\n‘closed’ – for example, if they cross their arms and legs, turn \\naway or avoid eye contact – this may indicate discomfort.\\nHandling sensitive information  \\nand third parties\\nConfidentiality is your top priority. Ask your patient’s permission \\nif you need to obtain information from someone else: usually a \\nrelative but sometimes a friend or a carer. If the patient cannot \\ncommunicate, you may have to rely on family and carers to \\nunderstand what has happened to the patient. Third parties may \\napproach you without your patient’s knowledge. Find out who \\nthey are, their relationship to the patient, and whether your patient \\nknows the third party is talking to you. Tell third parties that you \\ncan listen to them but cannot divulge any clinical information \\nwithout the patient’s explicit permission. They may tell you about \\nsensitive matters, such as mental illness, sexual abuse or drug \\nor alcohol addiction. This information needs to be sensitively \\nexplored with your patient to confirm the truth.\\nManaging patient concerns\\nPatients are not simply the embodiment of disease but individuals \\nwho experience illness in their own unique way. Identifying their \\ndisease alone is rarely sufficient to permit full understanding of \\nan individual patient’s problems. In each encounter you should \\ntherefore also seek a clear understanding of the patient’s personal \\nexperience of illness. This involves exploring the patients’ feelings \\nand ideas about their illness, its impact on their lifestyle and \\nfunctioning, and their expectations of its treatment and course.\\nPatients may even be so fearful of a serious diagnosis that \\nthey conceal their concerns; the only sign that a patient fears \\ncancer may be sitting with crossed fingers while the history is \\ntaken, hoping inwardly that cancer is not mentioned. Conversely, \\ndo not assume that the medical diagnosis is always a patient’s \\nmain concern; anxiety about an inability to continue to work \\nor to care for a dependent relative may be equally distressing.\\nThe ideas, concerns and expectations that patients have about \\ntheir illness often derive from their personal belief system, as well \\nas from more widespread social and cultural understandings of \\nillness. These beliefs can influence which symptoms patients \\nchoose to present to doctors and when. In some cultures, people \\nderive much of their prior knowledge about health, illness and \\ndisease from the media and the internet. Indeed, patients have \\noften sought explanations for their symptoms from the internet \\n(or from other trusted sources) prior to consulting a doctor, and \\nmay return to these for a second opinion once they have seen \\na doctor. It is therefore important to establish what a patient \\nalready understands about the problem. This allows you and the \\npatient to move towards a mutual understanding of the illness.\\nShowing empathy\\nBeing empathic is a powerful way to build your relationship with \\npatients. Empathy is the ability to identify with and understand \\npatients’ experiences, thoughts and feelings and to see the world \\nas they do. Being empathic also involves being able to convey \\nthat understanding to the patient by making statements such \\nas ‘I can understand you must be feeling quite worried about \\nwhat this might mean.’ Empathy is not the same as sympathy, \\nOpening the encounter\\nAt the beginning of any encounter it is important to start to \\nestablish a rapport with the patient. Rapport helps to relax and \\nengage the person in a useful dialogue. This involves greeting \\nthe patient and introducing yourself and describing your role \\nclearly. A good reminder is to start any encounter with ‘Hello, \\nmy name is … .’ You should wear a name badge that can \\nbe read easily. A friendly smile helps to put your patient at \\nease. The way you dress is important; your dress style and \\ndemeanour should never make your patients uncomfortable or \\ndistract them. Smart, sensitive and modest dress is appropriate. \\nWear short sleeves or roll long sleeves up, away from your \\nwrists and forearms, particularly before examining patients or \\ncarrying out procedures. Avoid hand jewellery to allow effective \\nhand washing and reduce the risk of cross-infection (see Fig. \\n3.1). Tie back long hair. You should ensure that the patient is \\nphysically comfortable and at ease.\\nHow you address and speak to a patient depends on the \\nperson’s age, background and cultural environment. Some older \\npeople prefer not to be called by their first name and it is best to \\nask patients how they would prefer to be addressed. Go on to \\nestablish the reason for the encounter: in particular, the problems \\nor issues the patient wishes to address or be addressed. Ask \\nan open question to start with to encourage the patient to talk, \\nsuch as ‘How can I help you today?’ or ‘What has brought you \\nalong to see me today?’\\nGathering information\\nThe next task of the doctor in the clinical encounter is to \\nunderstand what is causing the patient to be ill: that is, to reach \\na diagnosis. To do this you need to establish whether or not \\nthe patient is suffering from an identifiable disease or condition, \\nand this requires further evaluation of the patient by history \\ntaking, physical examination and investigation where appropriate. \\nChapters 2 and 3 will help you develop a general approach to \\nhistory taking and physical examination; detailed guidance on \\nhistory taking and physical examination in specific systems and \\ncircumstances is offered in Sections 2 and 3.\\nFear of the unknown, and of potentially serious illness, \\naccompanies many patients as they enter the consulting room. \\nReactions to this vary widely but it can certainly impede clear recall \\nand description. Plain language is essential for all encounters. The \\nuse of medical jargon is rarely appropriate because the risk of \\nthe doctor and the patient having a different understanding of the \\nsame words is simply too great. This also applies to words the \\npatient may use that have multiple possible meanings (such as \\n‘indigestion’ or ‘dizziness’); these terms must always be defined \\nprecisely in the course of the discussion.\\nActive listening is a key strategy in clinical encounters, as it \\nencourages patients to tell their story. Doctors who fill every \\npause with another specific question will miss the patient’s \\nrevealing calm reflection, or the hesitant question that reveals \\nan inner concern. Instead, encourage the patient to talk freely \\nby making encouraging comments or noises, such as ‘Tell me \\na bit more’ or ‘Uhuh’. Clarify that you understand the meaning \\nof what patients have articulated by reflecting back statements \\nand summarising what you think they have said.\\nNon-verbal communication is equally important. Look for \\nnon-verbal cues indicating the patient’s level of distress and \\nmood. Changes in your patients’ demeanour and body language'),\n",

When using the telephone, it is \\neven more important to listen actively and to check your mutual \\nunderstanding frequently.\\nSimilarly, asynchronous communication with patients, using \\nemail or web-based applications, has been adopted by some \\ndoctors. This is not yet widely seen as a viable alternative \\nto face-to-face consultation, or as a secure way to transmit \\nconfidential information. Despite the communication challenges \\nthat it can bring, telemedicine (using telecommunication and other \\ninformation technologies) may be the only means of healthcare \\nprovision for patients living in remote and rural areas and its use is \\nlikely to increase, as it has the advantage of having the facility to \\nincorporate the digital collection and transmission of medical data.\\nProfessional responsibilities\\nClinical encounters take place within a very specific context \\nconfigured by the healthcare system within which they occur, \\nthe legal, ethical and professional frameworks by which we are \\nbound, and by society as a whole.\\nFrom your first day as a student, you have professional \\nobligations placed on you by the public, the law and your \\ncolleagues, which continue throughout your working life. Patients \\nmust be able to trust you with their lives and health, and you \\nwill be expected to demonstrate that your practice meets the \\nexpected standards (Box 1.3). Furthermore, patients want more \\nfrom you than merely intellectual and technical proficiency; they \\nwill value highly your ability to demonstrate kindness, empathy \\nand compassion.\\nwhich is about the doctor’s own feelings of compassion for or \\nsorrow about the difficulties that the patient is experiencing.\\nShowing cultural sensitivity\\nPatients from a culture that is not your own may have different \\nsocial rules regarding eye contact, touch and personal space. \\nIn some cultures, it is normal to maintain eye contact for \\nlong periods; in most of the world, however, this is seen as \\nconfrontational or rude. Shaking hands with the opposite sex \\nis strictly forbidden in certain cultures. Death may be dealt with \\ndifferently in terms of what the family expectations of physicians \\nmay be, which family members will expect information to be \\nshared with them and what rites will be followed. Appreciate and \\naccept differences in your patients’ cultures and beliefs. When \\nin doubt, ask them. This lets them know that you are aware of, \\nand sensitive to, these issues.\\nAddressing the problem\\nCommunicating your understanding of the patient’s problem \\nto them is crucial. It is good practice to ensure privacy for this, \\nparticularly if imparting bad news. Ask the patient who else they \\nwould like to be present – this may be a relative or partner – and \\noffer a nurse. Check patients’ current level of understanding and \\ntry to establish what further information they would like. Information \\nshould be provided in small chunks and be tailored to the patient’s \\nneeds. Try to acknowledge and address the patient’s ideas, \\nconcerns and expectations. Check the patient’s understanding \\nand recall of what you have said and encourage questions. After \\nthis, you should agree a management plan together. This might \\ninvolve discussing and exploring the patient’s understanding of \\nthe options for their treatment, including the evidence of benefit \\nand risk for particular treatments and the uncertainties around \\nit, or offering recommendations for treatment.\\nConcluding the encounter\\nClosing the consultation usually involves summarising the \\nimportant points that have been discussed during the consultation. \\nThis aids patient recall and facilitates adherence to treatment. \\nAny remaining questions that the patient may have should be \\naddressed, and finally you should check that you have agreed \\na plan of action together with the patient and confirmed \\narrangements for follow-up.\\nAlternatives to face-to-face \\nencounters\\nThe use of telephone consultation as an alternative to face-to-\\nface consultation has become accepted practice in parts of \\nsome healthcare systems, such as general practice in the UK. \\nHowever, research suggests that, compared to face-to-face \\nconsultations, telephone consultations are shorter, cover fewer \\nproblems and include less data gathering, counselling/advice \\nand rapport building. They are therefore considered to be most \\nsuitable for uncomplicated presentations. Telephone consultation \\nwith patients increases the chance of miscommunication, as \\nthere are no visual cues regarding body language or demeanour. \\nThe telephone should not be used to communicate bad news \\nor sensitive results, as there is no opportunity to gauge reaction \\nCourtesy General Medical Council (UK).\\n1.3 The duties of a registered doctor\\nKnowledge, skills and performance\\n• Make the care of your patient your first concern\\n• Provide a good standard of practice and care:\\n• Keep your professional knowledge and skills up to date\\n• Recognise and work within the limits of your competence\\nSafety and quality\\n•\\n Take prompt action if you think that patient safety, dignity or \\ncomfort is being compromised\\n• Protect and promote the health of patients and the public\\nCommunication, partnership and teamwork\\n•\\n Treat patients as individuals and respect their dignity:\\n• Treat patients politely and considerately\\n• Respect patients’ right to confidentiality\\n• Work in partnership with patients:\\n• Listen to, and respond to, their concerns and preferences\\n• Give patients the information they want or need in a way they \\ncan understand\\n• Respect patients’ right to reach decisions with you about their \\ntreatment and care\\n• Support patients in caring for themselves to improve and \\nmaintain their health\\n• Work with colleagues in the ways that best serve patients’ interests\\nMaintenance of trust\\n•\\n Be honest and open, and act with integrity\\n• Never discriminate unfairly against patients or colleagues\\n• Never abuse your patients’ trust in you or the public’s trust in the \\nprofession'),\n",

The obligations on doctors do not change \\nbecause they are communicating through social media rather than \\nface to face or through other conventional media. Indeed, using \\nsocial media creates new circumstances in which the established \\nprinciples apply.

Chaperones \\nare also advised if the patient is especially anxious or vulnerable, \\nif there have been misunderstandings in the past, or if religious \\nor cultural factors require a different approach to physical \\nexamination. Record the chaperone’s name and presence. If \\npatients decline the offer, respect their wishes and record this \\nin the notes. Tactfully invite relatives to leave the room before \\nphysical examination unless the patient is very apprehensive and \\nrequests that they stay. A parent or guardian should always be \\npresent when you examine children (p. 307).\\nThe room should be warm and well lit; subtle abnormalities \\nof complexion, such as mild jaundice, are easier to detect in \\nnatural light. The height of the examination couch or bed should \\nbe adjustable, with a step to enable patients to get up easily. \\nAn adjustable backrest is essential, particularly for breathless \\npatients who cannot lie flat. It is usual practice to examine a \\nrecumbent patient from the right-hand side of the bed. Ensure \\nthe patient is comfortably positioned before commencing the \\nphysical examination.\\nSeek permission and sensitively, but adequately, expose \\nthe areas to be examined; cover the rest of the patient with \\na blanket or sheet to ensure that they do not become cold. \\nAvoid unnecessary exposure and embarrassment; a patient may \\nappreciate the opportunity to replace their top after examination \\nof the chest before exposing the abdomen. Remain gentle \\ntowards the patient at all times, and be vigilant for aspects \\nof the examination that may cause distress or discomfort. \\nAcknowledge any anxiety or concerns raised by the patient \\nduring the consultation.\\nGeneral principles of physical \\nexamination\\nThe process of taking a history and conducting a physical \\nexamination is artificially separated in classical medical teaching, \\nto encourage learners to develop a structured approach to \\ninformation gathering. However, your physical assessment of \\npatients undoubtedly begins as soon as you see them, and \\nthe astute clinician may notice signs of disease, such as subtle \\nabnormalities of demeanour, gait or appearance, even before \\nthe formal consultation begins. The clinician can be likened to \\na detective, gathering clues, and the physical assessment of a \\npatient can then be seen as the investigation itself!\\nHistorically, great importance has been placed on the value \\nof empirical observation of patients in the formulation of a \\ndifferential diagnosis. Modern technological advances have \\nincreased the reliance on radiological and laboratory testing for \\ndiagnosis, sometimes even at the bedside (such as portable \\nultrasound or near-patient capillary blood ketone testing), and \\nthis has called into question the utility of systematic physical \\nexamination in modern practice. Nevertheless, the importance \\nof performing a methodical and accurate physical examination \\ncannot be overstated. The inconstancy of physical signs and \\nthe need to monitor patient progress by repeated bedside \\nassessment, often conducted by different clinicians, mean that \\na standardised approach to physical examination resulting in \\nreproducible findings is crucial. Additionally, the interpretation of \\nmany diagnostic investigations (such as detection of interstitial \\noedema on a chest X-ray in heart failure) is subject to variation \\nbetween clinicians, as is the detection of physical signs (such \\nas audible crackles on auscultating the lungs). Furthermore, \\nthe utility of many diagnostic investigations relies heavily on the \\npre-test probability (the likelihood of the disease being present \\nprior to the test being performed; p. 362), which depends on \\ninformation gathered during the history and examination. Finally, \\nthere are a number of conditions, or syndromes, that can be \\ndiagnosed only by the detection of a characteristic pattern of \\nphysical signs. Thus by mastering structured skills in physical \\nexamination, clinicians can improve the reliability and precision \\nof their clinical assessment, which, together with the appropriate \\ndiagnostic investigations, lead to accurate diagnosis.\\nPreparing for physical examination\\nIt is important to prepare both yourself and your patient for the \\nphysical examination. As a clinician, you must take reasonable \\nsteps to ensure you can give the patient your undivided attention, \\nin an environment free from interruption, noise or distraction. \\nAlways introduce yourself to the patient, shake hands (which \\nmay provide diagnostic clues; Box 3.1 and see later) and seek \\npermission to conduct the consultation. Make sure you have \\nthe relevant equipment available (Box 3.2) and that you have \\nobserved local hand hygiene policies (Fig. 3.1). As discussed \\non page 4, privacy is essential when assessing a patient. At the \\nvery least, ensure screens or curtains are fully closed around a \\nward bed; where possible, use a separate private room to avoid \\nbeing overheard. Seek permission from the patient to proceed to \\nexamination, and offer a chaperone where appropriate to prevent \\nmisunderstandings and to provide support and encouragement \\nfor the patient. Regardless of whether the patient is the same \\n3.1 Information gleaned from a handshake\\nFeatures Diagnosis\\nCold, sweaty hands Anxiety\\nCold, dry hands Raynaud’s phenomenon\\nHot, sweaty hands Hyperthyroidism\\nLarge, fleshy, sweaty hands Acromegaly\\nDry, coarse skin Regular water exposure\\nManual occupation\\nHypothyroidism\\nDelayed relaxation of grip Myotonic dystrophy\\nDeformed hands/fingers Trauma\\nRheumatoid arthritis\\nDupuytren’s contracture\\n3.2 Equipment required for a full examination\\n• Stethoscope\\n• Pen torch\\n• Measuring tape\\n• Ophthalmoscope\\n• Otoscope\\n• Sphygmomanometer\\n• Tendon hammer\\n• Tuning fork\\n• Cotton wool\\n• Disposable Neurotips\\n• Wooden spatula\\n• Thermometer\\n• Magnifying glass\\n• Accurate weighing scales and \\na height-measuring device \\n(preferably a calibrated, \\nwall-mounted stadiometer)\\n•\\n Personal protective equipment \\n(disposable gloves and apron)\\n• Facilities for obtaining blood \\nsamples and urinalysis'),\n",

Early warning scoring systems (which include \\nassessment of vital signs: pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate \\nand oxygen saturations, temperature, conscious level and pain \\nscore) are used routinely to assess unwell patients and these \\nclinical measurements aid decisions about illness severity and \\nurgency of assessment (p. 340). If your patient is distressed \\nor in pain, giving effective analgesia may take priority before \\nundertaking a more structured evaluation, although a concurrent \\nevaluation for the cause of the pain is clearly important.\\nFor the stable or generally well patient, a more measured \\nassessment can begin. Observe the patient before the consultation \\nbegins. Do they look generally well or unwell? What is their \\ndemeanour?

Patients \\nmay be wearing a medical identity bracelet or other jewellery \\nalerting you to an underlying medical condition or life-sustaining \\ntreatment. Note any tattoos or piercings; as well as there being \\npossible associated infection risks, these can provide important \\nbackground information (Fig. 3.2).

Small-muscle wasting \\nof the hands is common in rheumatoid arthritis, producing ‘dorsal \\nguttering’ of the hands, and also occurs in cervical spondylosis \\nwith nerve root entrapment. In carpal tunnel syndrome, median \\nnerve compression leads to wasting of the thenar muscles, also \\nseen in damage affecting the T1 nerve root (see Fig. 13.23).\\nDupuytren’s contracture is a thickening of the palmar fascia \\ncausing fixed flexion deformity, and usually affects the little and \\nring fingers (Fig. 3.5). Arachnodactyly (long, thin fingers) is typical \\nof Marfan’s syndrome (see Fig. 3.21B).

In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the hands \\nmay be cyanosed due to reduced arterial oxygen saturation but \\nwarm due to vasodilatation from elevated arterial carbon dioxide \\nlevels. In heart failure the hands are often cold and cyanosed \\nbecause of vasoconstriction in response to a low cardiac output. \\nIf they are warm, heart failure may be due to a high-output state, \\nsuch as hyperthyroidism.\\ncerebrovascular disease or Parkinsonism (see Fig. 7.17D).

Abnormalities of posture and movement \\ncan also be a clue to the patient’s overall wellbeing, and \\nmay represent pain, weakness or psychological or emotional \\ndisturbance.\\nFacial expression and speech\\nAs with gait and posture, a patient’s facial expression and how \\nthey interact with you can provide clues to their physical and \\npsychological wellbeing (Box 3.3). Reluctance to engage in the \\nconsultation may indicate underlying depression, anxiety, fear, \\nanger or grief, and it is important to recognise these emotions \\nto ensure that both the physical and the emotional needs of the \\npatient are addressed effectively. Some people conceal anxieties \\nand depression with inappropriate cheerfulness. Illness itself may \\nalter demeanour: frontal lobe disease or bipolar disorders may \\nlead to animated disinhibition, whereas poverty of expression \\nmay occur in depression or Parkinson’s disease. Physical signs in \\nthe face that are associated with specific diagnoses are covered \\nlater (see Box 3.9).\\nBe vigilant for abnormalities in the character of speech, such \\nas slurring (due to alcohol, for example, or dysarthria caused by \\nmotor neurone disease; p. 125), hoarseness (which can represent \\nrecurrent laryngeal nerve damage; p. 186) or abnormality of \\nspeech cadence (which could be caused by pressure of speech \\nin hyperthyroidism or slowing of speech in myxoedema; p. 197).\\nHands\\nStarting your physical contact with a patient with a handshake \\nnot only is polite but also may reveal relevant signs (see Box 3.1). \\nThe rare disease myotonic dystrophy (which is over-represented \\nin candidate assessments) causes a patient to fail to release \\nthe handgrip (due to delayed muscle relaxation).

A \\nyellowish discoloration is seen on the face, palms and soles \\nbut not the sclera or conjunctiva, and this distinguishes it from \\njaundice (Fig. 3.13).\\nDiscoloration\\nSkin discoloration can also occur due to abnormal pigments such \\nas the sallow yellow-brownish tinge in chronic kidney disease. \\nA bluish tinge is produced by abnormal haemoglobins, such as \\nsulphaemoglobin or methaemoglobin (see the section on cyanosis \\nlater), or by drugs such as dapsone.

In everyday practice the skin can provide insights \\ninto present and past medical disorders, as well as information \\nabout the patient’s social or mental status.\\nThe skin should be exposed where appropriate and inspected \\ncarefully for any abnormalities of pigmentation. Skin colour is \\ndetermined by pigments in the skin – melanin, an endogenous \\nbrown pigment, and carotene, an exogenous yellow pigment \\n(mainly derived from ingestion of carrots and other vegetables) \\n– as well as by the amount of oxyhaemoglobin (red) and \\ndeoxyhaemoglobin (blue) circulating in the dermis.\\nDepigmentation occurs in the autoimmune condition vitiligo, in \\nwhich there is often bilateral symmetrical depigmentation, commonly \\nof the face, neck and extensor aspects of the limbs, resulting \\nin irregular pale patches of skin (Fig. 3.10). It is associated with \\nother autoimmune diseases like diabetes mellitus, thyroid and \\nadrenal disorders, and pernicious anaemia. Hypopituitarism also \\nresults in pale skin due to reduced production of melanotrophic \\npeptides (see Fig. 10.10). Albinism is an inherited disorder in which \\npatients have little or no melanin in their skin or hair. The amount \\nof pigment in the iris varies; some individuals have reddish eyes \\nbut most have blue.\\nHyperpigmentation can be due to excess of the pituitary \\nhormone adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), as in adrenal \\ninsufficiency (or the very rare condition Nelson’s syndrome, \\nin which there is ACTH overproduction following bilateral \\nadrenalectomy for pituitary Cushing’s disease). It produces brown \\npigmentation, particularly in skin creases, recent scars, sites \\noverlying bony prominences, areas exposed to pressure such \\nas belts and bra straps, and the mucous membranes of the lips \\nand mouth, where it results in muddy brown patches (see Fig. \\n10.12B). Pregnancy and oral contraceptives may also cause \\nblotchy hyperpigmentation on the face, known as chloasma, \\nand pregnancy may increase pigmentation of the areolae, axillae, \\ngenital skin and linea alba (producing a dark line in the midline \\nof the lower abdomen, called a ‘linea nigra’).\\nHaemochromatosis\\nThis inherited condition of excessive iron absorption results in skin \\nhyperpigmentation due to iron deposition and increased melanin \\nproduction (Fig. 3.11).

In haematomas \\nthe pigment from extravasated blood may produce the \\nrange of colours in a bruise (ecchymosis).\\n•\\t Tenderness:\\tinflammatory\\tlumps\\tsuch\\tas\\tboils\\tor\\t\\nabscesses are usually tender or painful, while non-inflamed \\nswellings such as lipomas, skin metastases and \\nneurofibromas are characteristically painless.\\n•\\t Warmth:\\tinflammatory\\tlumps\\tand\\tsome\\ttumours,\\t\\nespecially if rapidly growing, may feel warm due to \\nincreased blood flow.\\nTransillumination\\nIn a darkened room, press the lighted end of a pen torch on to \\none side of the swelling. A cystic swelling, such as a testicular \\nhydrocoele, will light up if the fluid is translucent, providing the \\ncovering tissues are not too thick (see Fig. 15.9).\\nExamination sequence\\n• Inspect the lump, noting any change in the colour or \\ntexture of the overlying skin.\\n• Define the site and shape of the lump.\\n• Measure its size and record the findings diagrammatically.\\n• Gently palpate for tenderness or change in skin \\ntemperature.\\n• Feel the lump for a few seconds to determine if it is \\npulsatile.\\n• Assess the consistency, surface texture and margins of \\nthe lump.\\n• Try to pick up an overlying fold of skin to assess whether \\nthe lump is fixed to the skin.\\n• Try to move the lump in different planes relative to the \\nsurrounding tissues to see if it is fixed to deeper \\nstructures.\\n•\\n Compress the lump on one side; see and feel if a bulge \\noccurs on the opposite side (fluctuation). Confirm the \\nfluctuation in two planes. Fluctuation usually indicates that \\nthe lump contains fluid, although some soft lipomas can \\nfeel fluctuant.\\n•\\n Auscultate for vascular bruits.\\n• Transilluminate.\\nLymph nodes\\nPalpable lymphadenopathy (enlarged peripheral lymph nodes) \\nmay be local or generalised, and is of diagnostic and prognostic \\nsignificance in the staging of lymphoproliferative and other \\nmalignancies. Lymph nodes may also be palpable in normal \\npeople, especially in the submandibular, axilla and groin regions \\n(Fig. 3.26).\\nAs with any lump, note the size and position of the nodes \\n(normal nodes in adults are <\\n 0.5 cm in diameter) and assess \\nfixation to deeper structures (lymph nodes fixed to deep structures \\nor skin suggest malignancy). Assess consistency: normal nodes \\nfeel soft. In Hodgkin’s lymphoma, they are characteristically \\n‘rubbery’, in tuberculosis they may be ‘matted’, and in metastatic \\ncancer they feel hard. Acute viral or bacterial infection, including \\ninfectious mononucleosis, dental sepsis and tonsillitis, causes \\ntender, variably enlarged lymph nodes.\\nSize\\nMeasure the size of any lump (preferably using callipers).\\nPosition\\nThe source of some lumps may be obvious from position, such \\nas in the breast, thyroid or parotid gland; in other sites, such \\nas the abdomen, this is less clear. Multiple lumps may occur in \\nneurofibromatosis (see Fig. 3.20), skin metastases, lipomatosis \\nand lymphomas.\\nAttachment\\nMalignant masses commonly infiltrate adjacent tissues, causing \\nthem to feel fixed and immobile.\\nLymphatic obstruction may cause skin swelling with fine \\ndimpling where the skin is tethered by hair follicles, giving it an \\n‘orange peel’ appearance (peau d’orange; see Fig. 11.5). This \\nis common in malignant disease when attachment to deeper \\nstructures, such as underlying muscle, may also occur.\\nConsistency\\nThe consistency of a lump can vary from soft to ‘stony’ hard. \\nVery hard swellings are usually malignant, calcified or dense \\nfibrous tissue. Fluctuation indicates the presence of fluid, as in \\nan abscess, cyst or blister (Fig. 3.25), or in soft, encapsulated \\ntumours, such as lipoma. \\nEdge\\nThe margin may be well delineated or ill defined, regular or \\nirregular, and sharp or rounded. The margins of enlarged organs, \\nsuch as the thyroid gland, liver, spleen or kidney, can usually \\nbe defined more clearly than those of inflammatory or malignant \\nmasses. An indefinite margin suggests infiltrating malignancy, in \\ncontrast to the clearly defined edge of a benign tumour.\\nSurface and shape\\nThe surface and shape of a swelling can be characteristic. In \\nthe abdomen, examples include an enlarged spleen or liver, \\na distended bladder or the uterine fundus in pregnancy. The \\nsurface may be smooth or irregular: for example, the surface \\nof the liver is smooth in acute hepatitis but is often nodular in \\nmetastatic disease.\\nPulsations, thrills and bruits\\nArterial swellings (aneurysms) and highly vascular tumours are \\npulsatile, expanding in time with the arterial pulse. Other swellings \\nmay transmit pulsation if they lie over a major blood vessel. If the \\nblood flow through a lump is increased, a systolic murmur (bruit) \\nmay be auscultated; occasionally, with sufficient flow, a thrill may \\nbe palpable. Bruits are also heard over arterial aneurysms and \\narteriovenous malformations due to turbulent flow.\\nFig. 3.25 Blister on a leg.'),\n",

Determine whether the \\nmurmur is systolic or diastolic:\\n•\\n Systole begins with S1 (mitral and tricuspid valve \\nclosure). This occurs when left and right ventricular \\npressures exceed the corresponding atrial pressures. \\nFor a short period, all four heart valves are closed \\n(pre-ejection period). Ventricular pressures continue to \\nrise until they exceed those of the aorta and pulmonary \\nartery, causing the aortic and pulmonary valves to \\nopen. Systole ends with the closure of these valves, \\nproducing S\\n2.\\n• Diastole is the interval between S2 and S1. \\nPhysiologically, it is divided into three phases: early \\ndiastole (isovolumic relaxation), the time from the \\nclosure of the aortic and pulmonary valves until the \\nopening of the mitral and tricuspid valves; mid-diastole, \\nthe early period of ventricular filling when atrial \\npressures exceed ventricular pressures; and presystole, \\ncoinciding with atrial systole.\\n•\\n Murmurs of aortic and pulmonary regurgitation start in \\nearly diastole and extend into mid-diastole. The murmurs \\nof mitral or tricuspid stenosis cannot start before \\nmid-diastole. S\\n3 occurs in mid-diastole and S 4 in \\npresystole.\\nDuration\\n• The murmurs of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation start with \\nS1, sometimes muffling or obscuring it, and continue \\nthroughout systole (pansystolic; Fig. 4.23). The murmur \\nproduced by mitral valve prolapse does not begin until the \\nmitral valve leaflet has prolapsed during systole, producing \\na late systolic murmur (Fig. 4.23). The ejection systolic \\nmurmur of aortic or pulmonary stenosis begins after S\\n1 \\nreaches maximal intensity in mid-systole, then fades, \\nstopping before S\\n2 (Fig. 4.24).\\nCharacter and pitch\\n• The quality of a murmur is subjective but terms such as \\nharsh, blowing, musical, rumbling and high- or low-pitched \\ncan be useful. High-pitched murmurs often correspond to \\nmechanism is similar to that of an opening snap.

They occur in mitral valve prolapse \\n(Fig. 4.22C) and may be associated with a late systolic murmur.\\nMechanical heart valves can make a sound when they close \\nor open. The closure sound is normally louder, especially with \\nmodern valves. The sounds are high-pitched, ‘metallic’ and often \\npalpable, and may even be heard without a stethoscope. A \\nmechanical mitral valve replacement makes a metallic S\\n1 and \\na sound like a loud opening snap early in diastole (Fig. 4.22D). \\nMechanical aortic valves have a loud, metallic S\\n2 and an opening \\nsound like an ejection click at the start of systole (Fig. 4.22E). \\nThey are normally associated with a flow murmur.\\nPericardial rub (friction rub) is a coarse scratching sound, often \\nwith systolic and diastolic components. It is best heard using \\nthe diaphragm with the patient holding their breath in expiration. \\nIt may be audible over any part of the precordium but is often \\nlocalised, varying in intensity over time and with the position of \\nthe patient. It is most often heard in acute pericarditis or a few \\ndays after an extensive myocardial infarction. A pleuropericardial \\nrub is a similar sound that occurs in time with the cardiac cycle, \\nbut is also influenced by respiration and is pleural in origin. \\nOccasionally, a ‘crunching’ noise can be heard, caused by gas \\nin the pericardium (pneumopericardium).\\nMurmurs\\nHeart murmurs are produced by turbulent flow across an abnormal \\nvalve, septal defect or outflow obstruction. ‘Innocent’ murmurs \\nare caused by increased velocity of flow through a normal valve \\nand occur when stroke volume is increased, as in pregnant \\nwomen, athletes with resting bradycardia or patients with fever.\\nExamination sequence\\nTiming\\n• Identify the first and second heart sounds, S 1 and S2, \\nrespectively.

Many patients with neuropathy cannot \\neven bear the pressure of bedclothes on their feet.\\nTissue loss (ulceration and/or gangrene)\\nIn patients with severe lower limb PAD, perfusion is inadequate to \\nsupport the tissues, and areas of tissue loss (gangrene) develop at \\nthe tips of the digits, gradually spreading proximally.

It is \\nmost commonly caused by an embolus from the heart or by \\nthrombosis in situ of a pre-existing atherosclerotic plaque in one \\nof the mesenteric vessels. It is often hard to diagnose in the early \\nstages, as patients typically present initially with severe abdominal \\npain that is out of proportion to often unimpressive abdominal \\nsigns. Presentation with severe abdominal pain, shock, bloody \\ndiarrhoea and profound metabolic acidosis indicates infarction \\nof the bowel, which carries a high mortality rate. Rarely, renal \\nangle pain occurs from renal infarction or ischaemia, and is \\nassociated with visible or non-visible haematuria.\\nAny patient suspected of having visceral ischaemia should \\nundergo urgent CT angiography.\\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm\\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal focal dilatation \\nof\\tthe\\taorta\\tto\\tat\\tleast\\t150%\\tof\\tits\\tnormal\\tdiameter\\t(Fig.\\t4.32).\\t\\nIt is often diagnosed incidentally during a CT scan or alternative \\nimaging for other reasons.\\nPatients may present with abdominal and/or back pain, or \\noccasionally with more subtle signs such as an awareness of \\nabdominal pulsation or observation of ripples in the water when \\nthey are in the bath (wave sign). However, most patients are \\nasymptomatic until the aneurysm ruptures.\\nThe classical features of AAA rupture include abdominal/back \\npain, pulsatile abdominal mass, syncope and shock (hypotension), \\nbut these are not always present and it is important to have \\na low threshold of suspicion and consider early referral and/\\nor CT imaging.\\nDigital ischaemia\\nBlue toes\\nBlue toe syndrome occurs when there is atheroembolism from \\nan AAA or alternative proximal embolic source (such as popliteal \\naneurysm or atherosclerotic plaque). Patchy bluish discoloration \\nappears over the toes and forefoot of one or both feet. There is \\nusually a full set of pedal pulses. Although seemingly innocuous, \\nthis symptom should be taken seriously, as small emboli may \\nherald the risk of a major embolus leading to acute limb ischaemia \\nand even limb loss.\\nVasospastic symptoms\\nRaynaud’s phenomenon is digital ischaemia induced by cold \\nand emotion. It has three phases (Fig. 4.33):\\n•\\t pallor:\\tdue\\tto\\tdigital\\tartery\\tspasm\\tand/or\\tobstruction\\n•\\t cyanosis:\\tdue\\tto\\tdeoxygenation\\tof\\tstatic\\tvenous\\tblood\\t\\n(this phase may be absent)\\n•\\t redness:\\tdue\\tto\\treactive\\thyperaemia.\\nRaynaud’s phenomenon may be primary (Raynaud’s disease) \\nand caused by idiopathic digital artery vasospasm, or secondary to \\nother conditions (Raynaud’s syndrome) such as drugs, connective \\ntissue disease, hyperviscosity syndromes or use of power tools. \\nWhile\\tfor\\tmost\\tpatients\\tthis\\tis\\ta\\tself-limiting\\tcondition,\\ta\\tsmall\\t\\nminority develop tissue loss.\\nPatients over 40 years old presenting with unilateral Raynaud’s \\nphenomenon should be investigated for underlying PAD, especially \\nif they have cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes or a smoking \\nhabit.\\nindicating impending muscle infarction.

In \\nthis situation the patient is likely to have a past history of \\nclaudication.\\nCompartment syndrome\\nThe perfusion pressure of a muscle is the difference between \\nthe mean arterial pressure and the pressure within the fascial \\ncompartment within which it lies. Compartment syndrome \\noccurs where there is increased pressure within the fascial \\ncompartments of the limb that compromises the perfusion \\nand viability of muscle and nerves. The calf is most commonly \\naffected and the two leading causes are lower limb trauma \\n(such as fractured tibia) and reperfusion injury following treatment \\nof acute lower limb ischaemia. Failure to recognise and treat \\ncompartment syndrome may result in limb amputation. The \\nkey symptom is severe pain that is often unrelieved by opioids \\nand exacerbated by active or passive movement. It is worth \\nremembering that peripheral pulses are usually present, since \\nthe major arteries lie outside the fascial compartments and are \\nnot affected by increased compartment pressure. Compartment \\nmonitors can be used as an adjunct to measure compartment  \\npressure.\\nAbdominal pain\\nMesenteric ischaemia\\nBecause of the rich collateral circulation of the gut, usually two of \\nthe three major visceral arteries (coeliac trunk, superior and inferior \\nmesenteric arteries) must be critically stenosed or occluded before \\nsymptoms and signs of chronic mesenteric arterial insufficiency \\noccur.

Despite high fever, the \\npatient may complain of feeling cold and seek extra clothing. \\nRigors usually indicate bacterial sepsis; lobar pneumonia and \\nacute pyelonephritis are the most common causes. They can \\nbe misinterpreted as seizures but the retention of consciousness \\nand associated pyrexia suggest rigors.\\nNight sweats are more closely associated with chronic \\ninfection (such as tuberculosis) and malignancy or lymphoma \\nrather than acute infection.

It generates a hollow, ringing sound accompanied by \\na palpable resonance over air-filled lung, but a dull thud lacking \\nresonance over consolidation or fluid. The absolute quality and \\nvolume of the percussed sound vary widely between individuals \\nwith differing chest wall thickness, muscularity and subcutaneous \\nfat, and is of little value. The value of percussion lies in detecting \\nasymmetry of resonance between mirror image positions on the \\nright and left sides.\\nExamination sequence \\n• To percuss the chest, apply the middle finger of your \\nnon-dominant hand firmly to an intercostal space, parallel \\nto the ribs, and drum the middle phalanx with the flexed \\ntip of your dominant index or middle finger (Fig. 5.16A).\\n•\\n Percuss in sequence, comparing areas on the right with \\ncorresponding areas on the left before moving to the next \\nlevel (Fig. 5.16B).\\n•\\n Posteriorly, the scapular and spinal muscles obstruct \\npercussion, so position the patient sitting forwards with \\ntheir arms folded in front to move the scapulae laterally. \\nPercuss a few centimetres lateral to the spinal muscles, \\ntaking care to compare positions the same distance from \\nthe midline on right and left (Fig. 5.16C).\\nIn healthy people, anterior chest percussion is symmetrical \\nexcept for the area immediately lateral to the lower left sternal \\nedge, where the right ventricle causes dullness; this ‘cardiac \\ndullness’ is lost in hyperinflated patients in whom the lingula \\noverlies the heart (see Fig. 5.5). Clear resonance is the usual \\nfinding over a pneumothorax, although the difference between \\nnormal lung and pneumothorax may be quite subtle because \\nasthma or COPD), forced, rapid inspiration often causes visible \\nindrawing of the skin in the intercostal spaces during inspiration, \\nseen more easily with tangential light (see Fig. 5.6A).\\nPalpation\\nExamination sequence\\n• Locate the apex beat, the most inferior and lateral place \\nwhere the finger is lifted by the twisting systolic movement \\nof the cardiac apex.

Pull your hands medially towards each \\nother to tighten any loose skin, and use your thumbs (off \\nthe skin) as pointers to judge how much each hand moves \\noutwards when the patient is instructed to take a full \\nbreath in (Fig. 5.14).

Normal breath \\nsounds are relatively quiet, so the greater area of contact offered \\nby the diaphragm is usually well adapted to chest auscultation. \\nThe two common exceptions are in patients with:\\n•\\t A\\tcachectic\\tchest\\twall\\twith\\tsunken\\tintercostal\\tspaces,\\t\\nwhere it may be impossible to achieve flat skin contact \\nwith the diaphragm.\\n•\\t A\\thairy\\tchest\\twall,\\twhere\\tmovement\\tof\\tchest\\thairs\\tagainst\\t\\nthe diaphragm are easily mistaken for lung crackles.

The symmetry of \\nsounds is therefore the key feature.\\nExamination sequence \\n• Auscultate the apices, comparing right with left, and \\nchanging to the bell if you cannot achieve flat skin contact \\nwith the diaphragm.\\n•\\n Ask the patient to take repeated slow, deep breaths in \\nand out through their open mouth. Auscultate the anterior \\nchest wall from top to bottom, always comparing mirror \\nimage positions on right and left before moving down.\\n•\\n Use the same sequence of sites as for percussion (see \\nFig. 5.16B and C). Do not waste time by listening to \\nrepeated breath cycles at each position, unless you \\nsuspect an abnormality and wish to check.\\n•\\n Note whether the breath sounds are soft and muffled, \\nabsent, or loud and harsh (bronchial, like those heard over \\nthe\\tlarynx).\\tSeek\\tand\\tnote\\tany\\tasymmetry\\tand\\tadded\\t\\nsounds (see later), deciding which side is abnormal.\\n• Auscultate the lateral chest wall in the mid-axillary line, \\nagain comparing right with left before changing level.\\nnormal lung is almost all air. Resonance on percussion together \\nwith unilateral absent breath sounds indicates pneumothorax.\\nAuscultation\\nTo understand chest auscultation it is necessary to understand \\nthe origin of breath sounds. The tracheobronchial tree branches \\n23 times between the trachea and the alveoli. This results in an \\nexponential rise in the number of airways and their combined \\ncross-sectional area moving towards the alveoli. During a maximal \\nbreath in and out, the same vital capacity (about 5  L of air in \\nhealthy adults) passes through each generation of airway. In \\nthe larynx and trachea, this volume must all pass through a \\ncross-sectional area of only a few square centimetres and therefore \\nflow rate is fast, causing turbulence with vibration of the airway \\nwall and generating sound. In the distal airway, the very large \\ntotal cross-sectional area of the multitude of bronchioles means \\nthat 5 L can easily pass at slow flow rates, so flow is normally \\nvirtually silent. The harsh ‘bronchial’ sound generated by the \\nmajor airways can be appreciated by listening with the diaphragm \\nof the stethoscope applied to the larynx (try this on yourself).\\nMost of the sound heard when auscultating the chest wall \\noriginates in the large central airways but is muffled and deadened \\nby passage through overlying air-filled alveolar tissue; this, together \\nwith a small contribution from medium-sized airways, results in \\n‘normal’ breath sounds at the chest wall, sometimes termed \\n‘vesicular’. When healthy, air-filled lung becomes consolidated \\nby pneumonia or thickened and stiffened by fibrosis, sound \\nconduction is improved, and the centrally generated ‘bronchial’ \\nbreath sounds appear clearly and loudly on the overlying chest \\nwall. In the same way, with soft speech (‘say one, one, one’), \\nthe laryngeal sounds are muffled by healthy lung but heard \\nclearly and loudly at the chest wall overlying consolidation and \\nfibrosis, due to improved conduction of major airway sounds \\nthrough diseased lung.\\nWhen there is lobar collapse caused by a proximal bronchial \\nobstruction, the signs are different from those in simple \\nconsolidation. The usual findings are diminished expansion, \\nsometimes with chest asymmetry due to loss of volume, dullness \\nto percussion over the collapsed lobe, and reduced breath sounds \\nand vocal resonance.\\nWhen the lung tissue is physically separated from the chest \\nwall by intervening air (pneumothorax) or fluid (pleural effusion), \\nsound conduction is greatly impaired and the breath sounds \\nBCA\\nFig. 5.16 Percussion of the chest.

On completion of the history and examination \\nyou should have a broad idea of the category of respiratory \\nillness with which you are dealing. As with any system, consider \\nas you go the likely categories of disease and how these affect \\npresentation. This approach is summarised in Box 5.6.\\nInvestigations\\nSelecting\\tthe\\trelevant\\tinvestigation\\tdepends\\ton\\tthe\\tclinical\\tproblem\\t\\nrevealed on history and examination. Investigations are costly \\nand many carry risks, so choose tests capable of distinguishing \\nthe likely diagnoses and prioritise the most decisive ones. In \\nrespiratory disease, imaging of the lungs is fundamental, but \\nrespiratory function testing is equally important to distinguish \\nobstructive disease of the airways from the restrictive pattern \\nseen in many parenchymal diseases, and to quantify the degree \\nof abnormality. A summary of the appropriate initial investigations \\naccording to the type of respiratory presentation is included in \\nBox 5.7.\\nAdded sounds\\nThere are three common added sounds: wheezes, crackles \\nand rubs. Wheeze is a musical whistling sound accompanying \\nairflow and usually originates in narrowed small airways. It is \\nmost commonly expiratory, due to dynamic airway narrowing \\non expiration, but can also occur on inspiration. Usually, multiple \\nwheezing sounds are heard together (polyphonic wheeze); this \\nsign is common in asthma, bronchitis and exacerbation of COPD. \\nA solitary wheeze that is present consistently with each breath and \\ndoes not clear with coughing suggests a possible fixed bronchial \\nobstruction and can be an important sign of underlying cancer.\\nCrackles accompanying deep breathing are thought to \\nrepresent the sudden opening of small airways but sometimes \\nmay indicate secretions in the airways or underlying lung fibrosis. \\nIn healthy people, gravitational compression of the dependent \\nlung bases often causes a few crackles on the first few deep \\nbreaths; these are of no pathological significance. Crackles that \\npersist after several breaths and do not clear with a deliberate \\ncough are pathological. They are graded as ‘fine’, meaning soft, \\nmultiple crackles, to ‘coarse’, indicating loud, scanty crackles \\nthat\\ttend\\tto\\tchange\\twith\\teach\\tbreath.\\tShowers\\tof\\tfine\\tcrackles\\t\\nduring inspiration, resembling the sound made by peeling a \\nVelcro\\tfastener,\\tare\\tcharacteristic\\tof\\tinterstitial\\tpulmonary\\tfibrosis,\\t \\nand are most commonly heard at the lung bases posteriorly \\nand laterally. Fine crackles also occur in pulmonary oedema and \\nsome viral pneumonias. Coarse crackles are generally heard in \\npatients with significant purulent airway secretions such as those \\nwith bronchopneumonia or bronchiectasis. Inspiratory crackles \\nare also often heard over the areas of incompletely inflated lung \\nimmediately above a pleural effusion.\\nPleural rub is a rasping, grating sound occurring with each \\nbreath and sounding superficial, just under the stethoscope, like \\ntwo sheets of sandpaper rubbing together.

The stools are normal in colour.\\nPosthepatic/cholestatic jaundice\\nIn biliary obstruction, conjugated bilirubin in the bile does not \\nreach the intestine, so the stools are pale. Obstructive jaundice \\nmay be accompanied by pruritus (generalised itch) due to skin \\ndeposition of bile salts. Obstructive jaundice with abdominal pain \\nis usually due to gallstones; if fever or rigors also occur (Charcot’s \\ntriad), ascending cholangitis is likely. Painless obstructive jaundice \\nsuggests malignant biliary obstruction, as in cholangiocarcinoma \\nor cancer of the head of the pancreas. Obstructive jaundice can \\nbe due to intrahepatic as well as extrahepatic cholestasis, as in \\nprimary biliary cirrhosis, certain hepatotoxic drug reactions (Box \\n6.8) and profound hepatocellular injury.'),\n",

If the hernia reappears, it is a direct hernia.

It may extend beyond \\nthe external ring and enter the scrotum.

It is more common in older men and women (Fig. 6.20).\\nA femoral hernia projects through the femoral ring and into the \\nfemoral canal. Inguinal hernias are palpable above and medial \\nto the pubic tubercle. Femoral hernias are palpable below the \\ninguinal ligament and lateral to the pubic tubercle.\\nIn a reducible hernia the contents can be returned to the \\nabdominal cavity, spontaneously or by manipulation; if they \\ncannot, the hernia is irreducible.

An audible splash more than \\n4 hours after the patient has eaten or drunk anything indicates \\ndelayed gastric emptying, as in pyloric stenosis.\\nHernias\\nThe inguinal canal extends from the pubic tubercle to the \\nanterior superior iliac spine (Fig. 6.19). It has an internal ring at \\nthe mid-inguinal point (midway between the pubic symphysis \\nand the anterior superior iliac spine) and an external ring at the \\npubic tubercle. The femoral canal lies below the inguinal ligament \\nand lateral to the pubic tubercle.\\nHernias are common and typically occur at openings of the \\nabdominal wall, such as the inguinal, femoral and obturator \\ncanals, the umbilicus and the oesophageal hiatus.

Some symptoms, including loss of \\nconsciousness or amnesia, require an additional witness history; \\nmake every effort to contact such witnesses.\\nRemember the two key questions: where (in the nervous \\nsystem) is the lesion and what is the lesion?\\nNeurological symptoms may be difficult for patients to describe, \\nso clarify exactly what they tell you. Words such as ‘blackout’, \\n‘dizziness’, ‘weakness’ and ‘numbness’ may have different \\nmeanings for different patients, so ensure you understand what \\nthe person is describing.\\nAsk patients what they think or fear might be wrong with \\nthem, as neurological symptoms cause much anxiety. Patients \\ncommonly research their symptoms on the internet; searches \\non common benign neurological symptoms, like numbness or \\nweakness, usually list the most alarming (and unlikely) diagnoses \\nsuch multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease or brain tumours \\nfirst, and almost never mention more common conditions such \\nas carpal tunnel syndrome or functional disorders.\\nTime relationships\\nThe onset, duration and pattern of symptoms over time often \\nprovide diagnostic clues: for example, in assessing headache \\n(Box 7.1) or vertigo (see Box 9.3).\\nAsk:\\n•\\t When\\tdid\\tthe\\tsymptoms\\tstart\\t(or\\twhen\\twas\\tthe\\tpatient\\t\\nlast well)?\\n•\\t Are\\tthey\\tpersistent\\tor\\tintermittent?\\n•\\t If\\tpersistent,\\tare\\tthey\\tgetting\\tbetter,\\tgetting\\tworse\\tor\\t\\nstaying the same?\\nAnatomy and physiology\\nThe nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord (central \\nnervous system, CNS) and the peripheral nerves (peripheral \\nnervous system, PNS). The PNS includes the autonomic nervous \\nsystem, responsible for control of involuntary functions.\\nThe neurone is the functional unit of the nervous system. Each \\nneurone has a cell body and axon terminating at a synapse, \\nsupported by astrocytes and microglial cells. Astrocytes provide \\nthe structural framework for the neurones, control their biochemical \\nenvironment and form the blood–brain barrier.

The brainstem comprises the midbrain, pons \\nand medulla. The cerebellum lies in the posterior fossa, with two \\nhemispheres and a central vermis attached to the brainstem by \\nthree pairs of cerebellar peduncles. Between the brain and the \\nskull are three membranous layers called the meninges: dura mater \\nnext to the bone, arachnoid and pia mater next to the nervous \\ntissue. The subarachnoid space between the arachnoid and pia \\nis filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) produced by the choroid \\nplexuses. The total volume of CSF is between 140 and 270 mL \\nand there is a turnover of the entire volume 3–4 times a day; \\nthus CSF is produced at a rate of approximately 700 mL per day.\\nThe spinal cord contains afferent and efferent fibres arranged \\nin discrete bundles (pathways running to and from the brain), \\nwhich are responsible for the transmission of motor and sensory \\ninformation. Peripheral nerves have myelinated and unmyelinated \\naxons. The sensory cell bodies of peripheral nerves are situated in \\nthe dorsal root ganglia.

A tonic–clonic seizure (convulsion) is the \\nmost common form of generalised seizure, and typically follows a \\nstereotyped pattern with early loss of consciousness associated \\nwith body stiffening (tonic phase) succeeded by rhythmical jerking \\ncrescendoing and subsiding over 30–120 seconds (clonic phase); \\nthis is followed by a period of unresponsiveness (often with \\nheavy breathing, the patient appearing to be deeply asleep) and \\nfinally confusion as the patient reorientates (postictal phase). \\nThe history from the patient and witnesses can help distinguish \\nsyncope from epilepsy (Box 7.2). Focal seizures may or may not \\ninvolve loss of awareness (complete loss of consciousness is less \\ntypical) and are characterised by whichever part of the brain is \\ninvolved: for example, a focal motor seizure arising from the motor \\ncortex, or temporal lobe seizures characterised by autonomic \\nand/or psychic symptoms, often associated with automatisms \\nsuch as lip smacking or swallowing. Functional dissociative \\nattacks (also known as non-epileptic or psychogenic attacks, or \\npseudoseizures) are common, and may be difficult to distinguish \\nfrom epileptic seizures. These attacks are often more frequent \\nthan epilepsy, sometimes occurring multiple times in a day, and \\nmay last considerably longer, with symptoms waxing and waning. \\nOther features may include asynchronous movements, pelvic \\nthrusts, side-to-side rather than flexion/extension movements \\nand absence of postictal confusion. The widespread availability \\nof videophones allows witnesses to capture such events and \\nmay prove invaluable.\\n•\\t If\\tintermittent,\\thow\\tlong\\tdo\\tthey\\tlast,\\tand\\thow\\tlong\\tdoes\\t\\nthe patient remain symptom-free in between episodes?\\n•\\t Was\\tthe\\tonset\\tsudden\\tor\\tgradual/evolving?\\nPrecipitating, exacerbating or  \\nrelieving factors\\n•\\t What\\twas\\tthe\\tpatient\\tdoing\\twhen\\tthe\\tsymptoms\\t\\noccurred?\\n•\\t Does\\tanything\\tmake\\tthe\\tsymptoms\\tbetter\\tor\\tworse,\\t \\nsuch as time of day, menstrual cycle, posture or \\nmedication?\\nAssociated symptoms\\nAssociated symptoms can aid diagnosis. For example, headache \\nmay be associated with nausea, vomiting, photophobia (aversion \\nto light) and/or phonophobia (aversion to sound) in migraine; \\nheadache with neck stiffness, fever and rash may be associated \\nwith meningitis (Box 7.1).\\nCommon presenting symptoms\\nHeadache\\nHeadache is the most common neurological symptom and \\nmay be either primary or secondary to other pathology. Primary \\n(idiopathic) causes include:\\n•\\t migraine\\n•\\t tension-type\\theadache\\n•\\t trigeminal\\tautonomic\\tcephalalgias\\t(including\\tcluster\\t\\nheadache)\\n•\\t primary\\tstabbing,\\tcough,\\texertional\\tor\\tsex\\theadache\\n•\\t primary\\tthunderclap\\theadache\\n•\\t new\\tdaily\\tpersistent\\theadache.\\nSecondary (or symptomatic) headaches are less common, \\nbut include potentially life-threatening or disabling causes such \\nas subarachnoid haemorrhage or temporal arteritis. One of the \\nkey history aspects is rapidity of onset; isolated headache with \\na truly abrupt onset may represent a potentially serious cause \\nsuch as subarachnoid haemorrhage or cerebral vein thrombosis, \\nwhereas recurrent headache is much more likely to be migraine, \\nparticularly if associated with other migrainous features like aura, \\nnausea and/or vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia (Box \\n7.1). Asking patents what they do when they have a headache \\ncan be instructive. For example, abandoning normal tasks and \\nseeking a bed in a dark, quiet room suggest migraine, whereas \\npacing around the room in an agitated state, or even head \\nbanging, suggests cluster headache.\\nTransient loss of consciousness\\nSyncope is loss of consciousness due to inadequate cerebral \\nperfusion and is the most common cause of transient loss of \\nconsciousness (TLOC). Vasovagal (or reflex) syncope (fainting) \\nis the most common type and precipitated by stimulation of the \\nparasympathetic nervous system, as with pain or intercurrent \\nillness. Exercise-related syncope, or syncope with no warning or \\ntrigger, suggests a possible cardiac cause. TLOC on standing \\nis suggestive of orthostatic (postural) hypotension and may be \\ncaused by drugs (antihypertensives or levodopa) or associated \\nwith autonomic neuropathies, which may complicate conditions \\nsuch as diabetes.\\n7.2 Features that help discriminate vasovagal syncope  \\nfrom epileptic seizure\\nFeature Vasovagal syncope Seizure\\nTriggers Typically pain, illness, \\nemotion\\nOften none (sleep \\ndeprivation, alcohol, \\ndrugs)\\nProdrome Feeling faint/\\nlightheaded, nausea, \\ntinnitus, vision \\ndimming\\nFocal onset (not always \\npresent)\\nDuration of \\nunconsciousness\\n<\\n 60 s 1–2 mins\\nConvulsion May occur but usually \\nbrief myoclonic jerks\\nUsual, tonic–clonic \\n1–2 mins\\nColour Pale/grey Flushed/cyanosed, may \\nbe pale\\nInjuries Uncommon, \\nsometimes biting of \\ntip of tongue\\nLateral tongue biting, \\nheadache, generalised \\nmyalgia, back pain \\n(sometimes vertebral \\ncompression fractures), \\nshoulder fracture/\\ndislocation (rare)\\nRecovery Rapid, no confusion\\nGradual, over 30 mins; \\npatient is often confused, \\nsometimes agitated/\\naggressive, amnesic'),\n",

Haemorrhagic stroke \\nis much more frequent in Asian populations. Spinal strokes are \\nvery rare; patients typically present with abrupt bilateral paralysis, \\ndepending on the level of spinal cord affected. The anterior \\nspinal artery syndrome is most common and causes loss of \\nmotor function and pain/temperature sensation, with relative \\nsparing of joint position and vibration sensation below the level  \\nof the lesion.\\nDizziness and vertigo\\nPatients use ‘dizziness’ to describe many sensations. Recurrent \\n‘dizzy spells’ affect approximately 30% of those over 65 years \\nand can be due to postural hypotension, cerebrovascular disease, \\ncardiac arrhythmia or hyperventilation induced by anxiety and \\npanic.

As a guide, recurrent episodes of \\nvertigo lasting a few seconds are most likely to be due to BPPV; \\nvertigo lasting minutes or hours may be caused by Ménière’s \\ndisease (with associated symptoms including hearing loss, tinnitus, \\nnausea and vomiting) or migrainous vertigo (with or without  \\nheadache).\\nFunctional neurological symptoms\\nMany neurological symptoms are not due to disease. These \\nsymptoms are often called ‘functional’ but other (less useful \\nand more pejorative) terms include psychogenic, hysterical, \\nsomatisation or conversion disorders. Presentations include \\nblindness, tremor, weakness and collapsing attacks, and patients \\nwill often describe numerous other symptoms, with fatigue, \\nlethargy, pain, anxiety and other mood disorders commonly \\nassociated.\\tDiagnosing\\tfunctional\\tsymptoms\\trequires\\texperience\\t\\nand patience (p. 363). Clues include symptoms not compatible \\nwith disease (such as retained awareness of convulsing during \\nnon-epileptic attacks, or being able to walk normally backwards \\nbut not forwards), considerable variability in symptoms (such \\nas intermittent recovery of a hemiparesis), multiple symptoms \\n(often with numerous previous assessments by other specialties, \\nparticularly gynaecology, gastroenterology, ear, nose and throat \\nand cardiorespiratory) and multiple unremarkable investigations, \\nleading to numerous different diagnoses. The size of a patient’s \\ncase notes can sometimes be a clue in itself! Beware of labelling \\nsymptoms as functional simply because they appear odd or \\ninexplicable.

Patients may lie with \\nflexed hips to ease their symptoms. Meningism suggests infection \\n(meningitis) or blood within the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid \\nhaemorrhage) but can occur with non-neurological infections, such \\nas urinary tract infection or pneumonia. Conversely, absence of \\nmeningism does not exclude pathology within the subarachnoid \\nspace.\\tIn\\tmeningitis,\\tneck\\tstiffness\\thas\\trelatively\\tlow\\tsensitivity\\t\\nbut higher specificity.

Kernig’s sign is \\npositive when extension is resisted by spasm in the \\nhamstrings. Kernig’s sign is absent with local causes of \\nneck stiffness, such as cervical spine disease or raised \\nintracranial pressure.\\nDrug history\\nAlways enquire about drugs, including prescribed, over-the-\\ncounter, complementary and recreational/illegal ones, as they \\ncan give rise to many neurological symptoms (for example, \\nphenytoin toxicity causing ataxia; excessive intake of simple \\nanalgesia causing medication overuse headache; use of cocaine \\nprovoking convulsions).\\nFamily history\\nObtain a family history for at least first-degree relatives: \\nparents,\\tsiblings\\tand\\tchildren.\\tIn\\tsome\\tcommunities,\\tparental\\t\\nconsanguinity is common, increasing the risk of autosomal \\nrecessive conditions, so you may need to enquire sensitively about  \\nthis. Many neurological disorders are caused by single-gene \\ndefects, such as myotonic dystrophy or Huntington’s disease. \\nOthers have important polygenic influences, as in multiple \\nsclerosis or migraine. Some conditions have a variety of \\ninheritance patterns; for example, Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease \\nmay be autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X-linked. \\nMitochondria\\tuniquely\\thave\\ttheir\\town\\tDNA,\\tand\\tabnormalities\\tin\\t\\nthis\\tDNA\\tcan\\tcause\\ta\\trange\\tof\\tdisorders\\tthat\\tmanifest\\tin\\tmany\\t\\ndifferent systems (such as diabetes, short stature and deafness), \\nand may cause common neurological syndromes such as migraine \\nor epilepsy. Some diseases, such as Parkinson’s or motor \\nneurone disease, may be either due to single-gene disorders  \\nor sporadic.\\nSocial history\\nSocial circumstances are relevant. How are patients coping with \\ntheir symptoms? Are they able to work and drive? What are their \\nsupport circumstances, and are these adequate?\\nAlcohol is the most common neurological toxin and damages \\nboth the CNS (ataxia, seizures, dementia) and the PNS \\n(neuropathy). Poor diet with vitamin deficiency may compound \\nthese problems and is relevant in areas affected by famine and \\nalcoholism or dietary exclusion. Vegetarians may be susceptible \\nto vitamin B\\n12 deficiency. Recreational drugs may affect the \\nnervous system; for example, nitrous oxide inhalation causes \\nsubacute combined degeneration of the cord due to dysfunction \\nof the vitamin B\\n12 pathway, and smoking contributes to vascular \\nand malignant disease. Always consider sexually transmitted \\nor blood-borne infection, such as human immunodeficiency \\nvirus\\t(HIV)\\tor\\tsyphilis,\\tas\\tboth\\tcan\\tcause\\ta\\twide\\trange\\tof\\t\\nneurological symptoms and are treatable. A travel history may \\ngive clues to the underlying diagnosis, such as Lyme disease \\n(facial palsy), neurocysticercosis (brain lesions and epilepsy) or  \\nmalaria (coma).\\nOccupational history\\nOccupational factors are relevant to several neurological disorders. \\nFor example, toxic peripheral neuropathy, due to exposure to \\nheavy or organic metals like lead, causes a motor neuropathy; \\nmanganese causes Parkinsonism. Some neurological diagnoses \\nmay adversely affect occupation, such as epilepsy in anyone who \\nneeds to drive or operate dangerous machinery. For patients with \\ncognitive disorders, particularly dementias, it may be necessary \\nto advise on whether to stop working.'),\n",

Muscle stretch \\nactivates the muscle spindles, which send a burst of afferent \\nsignals that lead to direct efferent impulses, causing muscle \\ncontraction. These stretch reflex arcs are served by a particular \\nspinal cord segment that is modified by descending upper motor \\nneurones. The most important reflexes are the deep tendon \\nand plantar responses, whereas others, such as abdominal and \\ncremasteric reflexes, are rarely tested and of questionable value. \\nDermatomal\\tinvolvement\\tmay\\tfurther\\thelp\\tlocalise\\ta\\tlesion;\\tfor\\t\\nexample, pain going down one leg, with an absent ankle jerk \\n(S1) and sensory loss on the sole of the foot (S1 dermatome), \\nlocalises to the S1 root, most commonly due to a prolapsed \\nintervertebral disc (sciatica).\\nExamination sequence \\n• Ask the patient to lie supine on the examination couch \\nwith the limbs exposed. They should be as relaxed and \\ncomfortable as possible, as anxiety and pain can cause an \\nincreased response.\\n•\\n Extend your wrist and allow the weight of the tendon \\nhammer head to determine the strength of the blow. Strike \\nyour finger that is palpating the biceps and supinator \\ntendons (otherwise it is painful for the patient), or the \\ntendon itself for the triceps, knee and ankle jerks.\\n•\\n Record the response as:\\n• increased (+++)\\n• normal (++)\\n• decreased (+)\\n• present only with reinforcement ( +/-)\\n• absent (0).\\nPrincipal (deep tendon) reflexes\\n• Ensure that both limbs are positioned identically with the \\nsame amount of stretch. This is especially important for \\nthe ankle reflex, where the ankle is passively dorsiflexed \\nbefore striking the tendon.\\n•\\n Compare each reflex with the other side; check for \\nsymmetry of response (Figs 7.19 and 7.20).\\n• Use reinforcement whenever a reflex appears to be absent. \\nFor knee and ankle reflexes, ask the patient to interlock \\ntheir fingers and pull one hand against the other on \\ncommand (‘Have a tug of war with yourself’), immediately \\nbefore you strike the tendon (Jendrassik’s manœuvre).\\n•\\n To reinforce upper limb reflexes, ask the patient to make a \\nfist with the contralateral hand.\\nHoffmann’s reflex\\n• Place your right index finger under the distal \\ninterphalangeal joint of the patient’s middle finger.\\n• Use your right thumb to flick the patient’s finger \\ndownwards.\\n• Look for any reflex flexion of the patient’s thumb.\\n• Assess individual muscles depending on the history. Ask \\nthe patient to undertake a movement. First assess whether \\nthey can overcome gravity. For example, give the \\ninstruction ‘Lift your right leg off the bed’ to test hip \\nflexion.

A zone of hyperaesthesia may be found in \\nthe dermatomes immediately above the level of sensory loss. \\nSyringomyelia (a fluid-filled cavity within the spinal cord) can \\nresult in a dissociated pattern of altered spinothalamic (pain \\nand temperature) sensation and motor function, with sparing \\nof dorsal column (touch and vibration) sensation.\\nWhen one-half of the spinal cord is damaged, the Brown–\\nSéquard syndrome may occur. This is characterised by ipsilateral \\nupper motor neurone weakness and loss of touch, vibration and \\njoint position sense, with contralateral loss of pain and temperature \\n(see Fig. 7.25B).\\nIntracranial lesions\\nBrainstem lesions are often vascular, and you must understand \\nthe relevant anatomy to determine the site of the lesion.

Internally the nasal septum, which is bone \\nposteriorly and cartilage anteriorly, separates the nose into two \\nnasal cavities that join posteriorly in the postnasal space. There \\nare three turbinates on each side of the nose, superior, middle and \\ninferior, which warm and moisten nasal airflow (Figs 9.13 and 9.14A).\\nOne important function of the nose is olfaction.

They are common and usually \\nheal spontaneously within a few days. Oral ulcers can be caused \\nby trauma, vitamin or mineral deficiency, cancer, lichen planus \\nor inflammatory bowel disease.\\nAnatomy and physiology\\nMouth\\nThe mouth extends from the lips anteriorly to the anterior tonsillar \\npillar posteriorly and is divided into the vestibule, between the \\nbuccal (cheek) mucosa and the teeth, and the oral cavity internal \\nto the teeth. The oral cavity contains the anterior two-thirds of \\nthe tongue, the floor of the mouth, the hard palate and the inner \\nsurfaces of the gums and teeth (Fig. 9.18). The tongue anteriorly \\nhas filiform papillae containing taste buds, giving the tongue its \\nvelvet texture. The circumvallate papillae are groups of taste \\nbuds marking the boundary between the anterior two-thirds \\nand posterior third of the tongue.\\nSaliva is secreted into the mouth from the parotid, submandibular \\nand sublingual salivary glands (Fig. 9.19). The parotid gland is \\nsituated anterior to the ear and has a superficial and deep lobe \\nrelative to the facial nerve that runs through it. The parotid duct \\nopens into the buccal mucosa opposite the second upper molar. \\nThe submandibular gland lies anterior and medial to the angle \\nof the mandible and its duct opens into the floor of the mouth \\nnext to the frenulum of the tongue (see Fig. 9.18).\\nThroat\\nThe pharynx is a shared upper aerodigestive channel that runs \\nfrom the anterior tonsillar pillar to the laryngeal inlet. The larynx \\n(‘voice box’) is responsible for phonation and also has a protective \\nfunction to prevent aspiration. It consists of two external cartilages, \\nthe thyroid cartilage (Adam’s apple) and the cricoid cartilage \\n(prominence at the top of the trachea; see Fig. 10.1A). The \\nmembrane between the two is called the cricothyroid membrane; \\na cricothyroidotomy may be performed by an experienced \\nclinician at this site as an emergency procedure to obtain an \\nairway. The sensory supply to the larynx is via the superior and \\nrecurrent laryngeal branches of cranial nerve X (vagus).

Diseases may result \\nfrom excessive or inadequate hormone production, or target \\norgan hypersensitivity or resistance to the hormone. The main \\nendocrine glands are the pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, gonads \\n(testes and ovaries), parathyroids and the endocrine pancreas. \\nWith the notable exception of the pancreatic islet cells (which \\nrelease insulin) and the parathyroids, most endocrine glands \\nare themselves controlled by hormones released from the  \\npituitary.\\nSince hormones circulate throughout the body, symptoms and \\nsigns of endocrine disease are frequently non-specific, affecting \\nmany body systems (Box 10.1). Often, endocrine disease is \\npicked up incidentally during biochemical testing or radiological \\nimaging. Careful history taking and examination are required to \\nrecognise characteristic patterns of disease. Thyroid disease and \\ndiabetes mellitus are common and frequently familial; establishing \\na detailed family history is therefore important. Some less common \\nendocrine disorders (such as multiple endocrine neoplasia) show \\nan autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.\\nTHE THYROID\\nAnatomy and physiology\\nThe thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland that lies inferior to the \\ncricoid cartilage, approximately 4 cm below the superior notch \\nof the thyroid cartilage (Fig. 10.1A). The normal thyroid has a \\nvolume of <\\n 20 mL and is palpable in about 50% of women and \\n25% of men. It is comprised of a central isthmus approximately \\n1.5 cm wide, covering the second to fourth tracheal rings, and \\ntwo lateral lobes that are usually no larger than the distal phalanx \\nof the patient’s thumb. The gland may extend into the superior \\nmediastinum and can be partly or entirely retrosternal. Rarely, it \\ncan be located higher in the neck along the line of the thyroglossal \\nduct, an embryological remnant of the descent of the thyroid \\nfrom the base of the tongue to its final position. Thyroglossal \\ncysts can also arise from the thyroglossal duct; they often occur \\nat the level of the hyoid bone (Fig. 10.1A) and characteristically \\nmove upwards on tongue protrusion. The thyroid is attached to \\nthe pretracheal fascia and thus moves superiorly on swallowing \\nor neck extension.\\nThyrotoxicosis is a clinical state of increased metabolism caused \\nby elevated circulating levels of thyroid hormones. Graves’ disease \\nis the most common cause (Fig. 10.2 and Box 10.2). It is an \\nautoimmune disease with a familial component and is 5–10 \\ntimes more common in women, usually presenting between 30 \\nand 50 years of age. Other causes include toxic multinodular \\ngoitre, solitary toxic nodule, thyroiditis and excessive thyroid \\nhormone ingestion.\\nHypothyroidism is caused by reduced levels of thyroid \\nhormones, usually due to autoimmune Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, \\nand affects women approximately six times more commonly \\nthan men. Most other causes are iatrogenic and include previous \\nradioiodine therapy or surgery for Graves’ disease.\\nThe history\\nCommon presenting symptoms\\nNeck swelling\\nGoitre is enlargement of the thyroid gland (Fig. 10.3). It is not \\nnecessarily associated with thyroid dysfunction and most patients'),\n",

Graves’ \\nophthalmopathy is characteristically associated with \\nrestriction of upgaze.\\nLid retraction (a staring appearance due to widening of the \\npalpebral fissure) and lid lag (see earlier) are common eye signs \\nassociated with hyperthyroidism. Both are thought to be due \\nto contraction of the levator muscles as a result of sympathetic \\nhyperactivity. Periorbital puffiness (myxoedema) is sometimes \\nseen in hypothyroidism.\\nGraves’ ophthalmopathy occurs in around 20% of patients \\nand is caused by an inflammatory infiltration of the soft tissues \\nand extraocular muscles (see Fig. 10.2A,B). Features suggestive \\nof active inflammation include spontaneous or gaze-evoked \\neye pain, and redness or swelling of the lids or conjunctiva. \\nProptosis (protrusion of the globe with respect to the orbit) may \\noccur in both active and inactive Graves’ ophthalmopathy and \\nis often referred to as exophthalmos.

Ask the patient to swallow \\nagain and feel the gland as it moves upwards.\\n•\\n Note the size, shape and consistency of any goitre and \\nfeel for any thrill.\\n• Palpate for cervical lymphadenopathy (see Fig. 3.27).\\n• Percuss the manubrium to assess for dullness due to \\nretrosternal extension of goitre.\\n• Auscultate with your stethoscope for a thyroid bruit. A \\nthyroid bruit (sometimes associated with a palpable thrill) \\nindicates abnormally high blood flow and is most \\ncommonly associated with Graves’ disease. It may be \\nconfused with other sounds: bruits from the carotid artery \\nor those transmitted from the aorta are louder along the \\nline of the artery.\\nEarly simple goitres are relatively symmetrical but may become \\nnodular with time. In Graves’ disease the surface of the thyroid is \\nusually smooth and diffuse; in uninodular or multinodular goitre \\nit is irregular (see Fig. 10.3). Diffuse tenderness is typical of \\nviral thyroiditis. Localised tenderness may follow bleeding into a \\nthyroid cyst. Fixation of the thyroid to surrounding structures (such \\nthat it does not move on swallowing) and associated cervical \\nlymphadenopathy increase the likelihood of thyroid malignancy. \\nFurther investigation of thyroid disorders is summarised in  \\nBox 10.3.\\nEyes\\nExamination sequence\\n• Look for periorbital puffiness or oedema, and lid  \\nretraction (this is present if the white sclera is visible  \\nabove the iris in the primary position of gaze; see  \\nFig. 10.2A).\\n• Examine for features of Graves’ ophthalmopathy, including \\nexophthalmos (look down from above and behind the \\npatient), lid swelling or erythema, and conjunctival redness \\nor swelling (chemosis).\\n•\\n Assess for lid lag: ask the patient to follow your index \\nfinger as you move it from the upper to the lower part of \\nthe visual field.

The tumour extends into the \\nsuprasellar cistern and is compressing the optic chiasm. Courtesy of  \\nDr Dilip Patel.\\nAnatomy and physiology\\nThe pituitary gland is enclosed in the sella turcica at the base of \\nthe skull beneath the hypothalamus. It is bridged over by a fold of \\ndura mater (diaphragma sellae) with the sphenoidal sinus below \\nand the optic chiasm above. Lateral to the pituitary fossa are the \\ncavernous sinuses, containing cranial nerves III, IV and VI and the \\ninternal carotid arteries. The gland comprises anterior and posterior \\nlobes. The anterior lobe secretes adrenocorticotrophic hormone \\n(ACTH), prolactin, growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating \\nhormone (TSH) and gonadotrophins (luteinising hormone (LH) \\nand follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)). The posterior lobe is \\nan extension of the hypothalamus, and secretes vasopressin \\n(antidiuretic hormone) and oxytocin.\\nThe history\\nCommon presenting symptoms\\nPituitary tumours are common and are found incidentally in around \\n10% of patients undergoing head computed tomography (CT) or \\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hypopituitarism can result \\nfrom a space-occupying lesion or from a destructive or infiltrative \\nprocess such as trauma, radiotherapy, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis \\nor metastatic disease. Pituitary infarction or haemorrhage can \\nresult in acute hypopituitarism (referred to as pituitary apoplexy) \\nand is a medical emergency; it is often associated with headache, \\nvomiting, visual impairment and altered consciousness.\\nNon-functioning pituitary adenomas may be asymptomatic \\nor may present with local effects, such as compression of the \\noptic chiasm causing visual loss (typically bitemporal upper \\nquadrantanopia or hemianopia; Fig. 10.8 and see Fig. 8.5)'),\n",

The openings of \\nthe lactiferous ducts are on the apex of the nipple, which is \\nerectile tissue. The nipple is in the fourth intercostal space in \\nthe mid-clavicular line, but accessory breast/nipple tissue may \\ndevelop anywhere down the nipple line (axilla to groin) (Figs 11.1 \\nand 11.2). The adult breast is divided into the nipple, the areola \\nand four quadrants (upper outer to lower inner), with an axillary tail \\n(of Spence) projecting from the upper outer quadrant (Fig. 11.3).\\nThe size and shape of the breasts are influenced by age, \\nhereditary factors, sexual maturity, phase of the menstrual cycle, \\nparity, pregnancy, lactation and nutritional state. Fat and stroma \\nsurrounding the glandular tissue determine the size of the breast, \\nexcept during lactation, when enlargement is mostly glandular. The \\nbreast responds to fluctuations in oestrogen and progesterone \\nlevels. Swelling and tenderness are common in the premenstrual \\nphase. The glandular tissue reduces and fat increases with age, \\nmaking the breasts softer and more pendulous. Lactating breasts \\nare swollen and engorged with milk, and are best examined \\nafter breastfeeding.\\nThe history\\nBenign and malignant conditions of the breast cause similar \\nsymptoms but benign changes are much more common. The \\nmost common presenting symptoms are a breast lump, breast \\npain, and skin and nipple changes. Men may present with \\ngynaecomastia (breast swelling). Women are often worried that \\nthey have breast cancer, whatever breast symptom they have, \\nand it is important to explore these concerns.\\nThe history of the presenting symptoms is crucial.

The normal uterus should feel \\nregular and be mobile and the size of a plum. The Fallopian \\ntubes cannot be felt and normal ovaries are palpable only in \\nvery slim women.\\nVulval changes include specific skin disease, infections such \\nas herpes or thrush, and malignancy. Visual abnormalities of the \\ncervix such as ulceration or bleeding suggest cervical pathology, \\nincluding polyps or malignancy. Tender nodules in the posterior \\nfornix suggest endometriosis, and both endometriosis and pelvic \\nadhesions cause fixation of the uterus. Acute pain when touching \\nthe cervix (cervical excitation) suggests an acute pelvic condition \\nsuch as infection, cyst accident or tubal rupture.\\nFibroids can cause uterine irregularity and enlargement. The \\nsize is related to that of the uterus in pregnancy. A tangerine-sized \\nuterus is 6 weeks, apple 8 weeks, orange 10 weeks and \\ngrapefruit 12 weeks. After 12 weeks the uterus can be palpated \\nsuprapubically on abdominal palpation. A large midline mass \\nmay be ovarian or uterine. Push the mass upwards with your \\nleft hand and feel the cervix with your right hand; if the mass \\nmoves without the cervix, this suggests it is ovarian.\\nInvestigations\\nCommon gynaecological investigations are summarised in Box \\n11.6. A woman of reproductive age should be considered \\npotentially pregnant and a pregnancy test is routine. The mainstay \\nof gynaecological investigation is a pelvic ultrasound scan, which \\ncan be carried out abdominally or transvaginally (Fig. 11.32). \\nEndometrial\\tbiopsy\\tis\\ta\\tcommon\\ttest,\\tparticularly\\tfor\\tPMB,\\tand\\t\\nis performed during vaginal examination using a suction catheter \\n(pipelle, Fig. 11.33). When a couple present with subfertility, \\nthe key female investigations are serum progesterone 1 week \\nbefore expected menses to confirm ovulation, and a test of \\ntubal patency (Fig. 11.34).\\n•\\n Push your fingers into the posterior fornix and lift  \\nthe uterus while pushing on the abdomen with your  \\nleft hand.\\n• Place your left hand above the umbilicus and bring  \\nit down, palpating the uterus between both hands  \\nand note its size, regularity and any discomfort  \\n(Fig. 11.30).\\n• Move your vaginal fingers into the anterior fornix and \\npalpate the anterior surface of the uterus, holding it in \\nposition with your abdominal hand.\\n•\\n Move your fingers to the lateral fornix and, with your left \\nhand above and lateral to the umbilicus, bring it down to \\nassess any adnexal masses between your hands on each \\nside (Fig. 11.31).\\n•\\n\\t If\\turinary\\tleakage\\toccurs\\twhen\\tthe\\tpatient\\tcoughs,\\ttry\\t\\nlifting the anterior vaginal wall with your fingers and asking \\nher to cough again.

They \\nhave their own blood, lymphatic and nerve supply, so testicular \\nproblems may cause abdominal pain and enlargement of the \\npara-aortic lymph nodes. The scrotum is a pouch with thin, \\npigmented, wrinkled skin that helps to regulate the temperature \\nof the testes (Fig. 11.42), as sperm production is most efficient \\nbelow body temperature. The left testis lies lower than the right. \\nEach\\ttestis\\tis\\toval,\\t3.5–4\\tcm\\tlong\\tand\\tcovered\\tby\\tthe\\ttunica\\t\\nalbuginea, which forms the posterior wall of the tunica vaginalis. \\nThis is a prolongation of the peritoneal tube that forms as the \\ntestis\\tdescends\\tduring\\tdevelopment.\\tIf\\tit\\tpersists,\\tit\\tmay\\tbe\\t\\nassociated with an indirect inguinal hernia sac or a congenital \\nhydrocoele. Along the posterior border of each testis is the \\nepididymis.\\nThe testes produce sperm and testosterone, starting at \\npuberty (10–15 years of age; see Fig. 15.18). Sperm mature in \\nthe epididymis and pass down the vas deferens to the seminal \\nvesicles. They are ejaculated from the urethra, together with \\nprostatic and seminal vesicle fluid, at orgasm.\\nThe penis has two cylinders of endothelium-lined spaces \\nsurrounded by smooth muscle, the corpora cavernosa (Fig. \\n11.43). These are bound with the bulbospongiosus surrounding \\nthe urethra, which expands into the glans penis. The penile skin \\nis reflected over the glans, forming the prepuce (foreskin). Sexual \\narousal causes a parasympathetically mediated increased blood \\nflow into the corpora cavernosa with erection to enable vaginal \\npenetration. Continued stimulation causes sympathetic-mediated \\ncontraction of the seminal vesicles and prostate, closure of the \\nbladder neck and ejaculation. Following orgasm, reduction in \\nblood inflow causes detumescence.\\nThe prostate and seminal vesicles contribute to seminal fluid. \\nAfter age 40 the prostate develops a trilobar structure because of \\nbenign enlargement. Two lateral lobes and a variable median lobe \\nprotrude into the bladder and may cause urethral and bladder \\noutflow obstruction. Prostate cancer develops in the peripheral \\ntissue of the lateral lobes and sometimes may be detected by \\ndigital rectal examination. Only the posterior aspect and the lateral \\nlobes of the prostate can be felt by rectal examination (p. 111).\\nThe history\\nDisorders of the male genitals may present as urinary symptoms, \\ngenital or pelvic pain, genital swellings, sexual dysfunction or \\ninfertility.\\nIn\\taddition\\tto\\tdocumenting\\tthe\\tman’s\\tmain\\tgenital\\tor\\turinary\\t\\nproblems, be sure to ask about:\\n•\\t the\\ttimescale\\tof\\ttheir\\tdevelopment\\n•\\t how\\tthey\\taffect\\tlifestyle\\tand\\tany\\tsexual\\tactivity\\n•\\t sexual\\tfunction,\\tif\\tappropriate\\n•\\t past\\tconceptions\\tor\\tproblems\\twith\\tfertility\\n•\\t general\\turological\\tsymptoms:\\n• genital swelling\\n• genital or pelvic pain\\n• lower urinary tract symptoms\\n• urethral discharge.\\nThere may be associated systemic upset or clinical signs \\nassociated with urological disease; a full history and examination \\nare therefore important.'),\n",

Varies between 1.002 and 1.035. Raised when kidneys actively reabsorb water, e.g. in fluid \\ndepletion or renal failure due to decreased perfusion. Abnormally low values indicate failure to concentrate urine\\npH Normally 4.5–8.0. In renal tubular acidosis, pH never falls < 5.3 despite acidaemia\\nGlucose Small amounts may be excreted by normal kidneys. Glycosuria may indicate poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. It may occur in \\nintrinsic renal disease when tubular glucose reabsorption is impaired\\nKetones Test is specific for acetoacetate and does not detect other ketones, e.g. β-OH butyrate, acetone. Ketonuria occurs in diabetic \\nketoacidosis, starvation, alcohol use and very-low-carbohydrate diets\\nProtein Varies between trace and 4+. The greater the degree of proteinuria, the more likely there is to be significant renal disease. Most \\npatients with nephrotic syndrome will have 4+ protein. The presence of both blood (≥\\n 2+) and protein (≥  2+), an ‘active urinary \\nsediment’, often indicates intrinsic renal disease. As urinalysis is semiquantitative, confirmatory laboratory quantification should be \\nundertaken using either a urine albumin  : creatinine or protein : creatinine ratio (see Box 12.4)\\nBlood ≥1+ is positive for non-visible haematuria. The test does not differentiate between haemoglobin and myoglobin. If you suspect \\nrhabdomyolysis, measure myoglobin with a specific laboratory test\\nBilirubin and \\nurobilinogen\\nBilirubin is not normally present. Urobilinogen may be up to 33  µmol/L in health.

If intermittent, with resolution \\nbetween episodes, it may be palindromic rheumatism.\\nExacerbating/relieving factors\\nPain from joints damaged by intra-articular derangement or \\nosteoarthritic degeneration worsens with exercise. Pain from \\ninflammatory arthritis worsens with rest. Pain from a septic joint \\nis present both at rest and with movement.\\nSeverity\\nApart from trauma, the most severe joint pain occurs in septic \\nand crystal arthritis. Disproportionately severe pain is seen \\nacutely in compartment syndrome (increased pressure in a \\nfascial compartment, compromising perfusion and viability of \\ncompartmental structures) and chronically in complex regional \\npain syndrome. Neurological involvement in diabetes mellitus, \\nleprosy (Hansen’s disease), syringomyelia and syphilis (tabes \\ndorsalis) may impair joint sensation, reducing pain despite obvious \\npathology on examination. Grossly abnormal joints may even \\nbe pain-free (Charcot joints). Partial muscle tears are painful; \\ncomplete rupture may be less so.\\nPatterns of joint involvement\\nDifferent patterns of joint involvement aid the differential diagnosis \\n(Fig. 13.3). Are the small or large joints of the arms or legs \\naffected? How many joints are involved? Involvement of one \\njoint is called a monoarthritis; 2–4 joints, oligoarthritis; and more \\nthan 4, polyarthritis.\\n•\\t Predominant\\tinvolvement\\tof\\tthe\\tsmall\\tjoints\\tof\\tthe\\thands\\t\\nand feet suggests an inflammatory arthritis, such as \\nrheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\\narthritis can develop over 24 hours, or more insidiously. Crystal \\narthritis (gout and pseudogout) causes acute, severe pain that \\ndevelops quickly, often overnight. Joint sepsis causes pain that \\ndevelops over 1–2 days.\\nCharacter\\nBone pain is penetrating, deep or boring, and is characteristically \\nworse at night. Localised pain suggests tumour, osteomyelitis \\n(infection), osteonecrosis or osteoid osteoma (a benign bone \\ntumour). Generalised bony conditions, such as osteomalacia, \\nusually cause diffuse pain.\\nFracture pain is sharp and stabbing, aggravated by attempted \\nmovement, and relieved by rest and splintage.\\nMuscle pain is often described as ‘stiffness’ or aching, and \\nis aggravated by use of the affected muscle(s).\\n‘Shooting’ pain is often caused by impingement of a peripheral \\nnerve or nerve root: for example, buttock pain, which ‘shoots \\ndown the back of the leg’, caused by lumbar disc protrusion.\\nProgressive joint pain in patients over 40 years of age is \\ncommonly caused by osteoarthritis.\\nFibromyalgia, a chronic pain syndrome, causes widespread, \\nconstant pain with little diurnal variation, which is poorly controlled \\nby conventional analgesic/anti-inflammatory drugs.\\nRadiation\\nPain from nerve compression radiates to the distribution of \\nthat nerve or nerve root (see Fig. 7.23), such as lower leg pain \\nin intervertebral disc prolapse, or hand pain in carpal tunnel \\nsyndrome. Neck pain radiates to the shoulder or scalp.

Pain in a lower \\nlimb is usually aggravated by weight bearing, so minimal time \\nis spent in the stance phase on that side. This results in a \\n‘dot–dash’ mode of walking. If the source of pain is in the spine, \\naxial rotatory movements are minimised, resulting in a slow gait \\nwith small paces. Patients with hip pain may lean towards the \\naffected side, as this decreases the compression force on the  \\nhip joint.\\nStructural change\\nPatients with limb-length discrepancy may limp or walk on tiptoe \\non the shorter side, with compensatory hip and knee flexion on \\nthe longer side. Assess for limb-length discrepancy (see Fig. \\n13.36). Other structural changes producing an abnormal gait \\ninclude joint fusion, bone malunion and contracture.\\nWeakness\\nThis may be due to nerve or muscle pathology or altered muscle \\ntone. In a normal gait the hip abductors of the stance leg raise \\nthe contralateral hemipelvis. In Trendelenburg gait, abductor \\nfunction is poor when weight-bearing on the affected side, so \\nthe contralateral hemipelvis falls (see Fig. 13.37).\\nCommon causes of a Trendelenburg gait are:\\n•\\t painful\\thip\\tjoint\\tproblems,\\tas\\tin\\tosteoarthritis\\n•\\t weak\\thip\\tabductors,\\tas\\tin\\tpoliomyelitis\\tor\\tafter\\thip\\t\\nreplacement\\n•\\t structural\\thip\\tjoint\\tproblems,\\tas\\tin\\tcongenital\\tdislocation.\\nA high-stepping gait occurs in foot drop due to common \\nperoneal nerve palsy. The knee is raised high to allow clearance \\nof the weak foot.\\nIncreased tone\\nThis occurs with upper motor neurone lesions, such as \\ncerebrovascular accident (stroke) or cerebral palsy. The gait \\ndepends on the specific lesion, contractures and compensatory \\nmechanisms (see Fig. 7.17).\\nSpine\\nThe spine is divided into the cervical, thoracic, lumbar and \\nsacral segments (Fig. 13.11). Most spinal diseases affect \\nmultiple segments, causing altered posture or function of the \\nwhole spine. Spinal disease may occur without local symptoms, \\npresenting with referred pain, neurological symptoms or signs in \\nthe trunk or limbs. Common causes of spinal pain are shown in  \\nBox 13.9.\\nDefinitions\\nScoliosis is lateral curvature of the spine (Fig. 13.12A).\\nKyphosis is curvature of the spine in the sagittal (anterior–\\nposterior) plane, with the apex posterior (Fig. 13.12B). The thoracic \\nspine normally has a mild kyphosis.\\nLordosis is curvature of the spine in the sagittal plane, with \\nthe apex anterior (Fig. 13.12C).\\nGibbus is a spinal deformity caused by an anterior wedge \\ndeformity of a single vertebra, producing localised angular flexion \\n(Fig. 13.12D).\\n• Stand behind the patient, hold their pelvis, and ask them \\nto turn from side to side without moving their feet.\\n• Ask them to slide their hand down the lateral aspect of \\ntheir leg towards their knee.\\n• Stand in front of the patient. Ask them to put their ear to \\neach shoulder in turn.\\n• Ask the patient to look down to the floor and then up to \\nthe ceiling.\\n• Ask them to open their jaw wide and move it from side  \\nto side.\\nHypermobility\\nSome patients have a greater than normal range of joint movement. \\nIf this is severe, patients may present with recurrent dislocations \\nor sensations of instability. Milder cases may develop arthralgia \\nor be symptom-free. Mild hypermobility is normal but Marfan’s, \\nEhlers–Danlos and benign joint hypermobility syndromes (Box \\n13.8) cause significant hypermobility.\\nDetailed examination of the \\nmusculoskeletal system\\nThe GALS screen provides a rapid but limited assessment. This \\nsection describes the detailed examination required for thorough \\nevaluation.\\nGait\\nGait is the cyclical pattern of musculoskeletal motion that carries \\nthe body forwards. Normal gait is smooth, symmetrical and \\nergonomically economical, with each leg 50% out of phase with \\nthe other. It has two phases: stance and swing. The stance \\nphase is from foot-strike to toe-off, when the foot is on the \\nground and load-bearing.

Symptoms are worse in the morning or after inactivity, \\nand ease with movement. Morning stiffness is more marked \\nthan in osteoarthritis, lasting at least 30 minutes. Other clues \\nto the diagnosis are peripheral joint involvement, extra-articular \\nfeatures or a positive family history.\\nAcute onset of low back pain in a young adult, often associated \\nwith bending or lifting, is typical of acute disc protrusion (slipped \\ndisc). Coughing or straining to open the bowels exacerbates the \\npain. There may be symptoms of lumbar or sacral nerve root \\ncompression. Cauda equina syndrome occurs when a central disc \\nprolapse, or other space-occupying lesion, compresses the cauda \\nequina. There are features of sensory and motor disturbance, \\nincluding diminished perianal sensation and bladder function \\ndisturbance. The motor disturbance may be profound, as in \\nparaplegia. Cauda equina syndrome and spinal cord compression \\nare neurosurgical emergencies.\\nThe principal movements are flexion, extension, lateral flexion \\nand rotation. In flexion, the upper segments move first, followed \\nby the lower segments, to produce a smooth lumbar curve. \\nHowever, even with a rigid lumbar spine, patients may be able \\nto touch their toes if their hips are mobile.\\nIn the adult, the spinal cord ends at L2.

Ask them to flex their wrist \\nagainst your resistance.\\n• Pain is produced at the medial epicondyle and may be \\nreferred down the flexor aspect of the arm.\\nShoulder\\nAnatomy and physiology\\nThe shoulder joint consists of the glenohumeral joint, \\nacromioclavicular joint and subacromial space. Movement also \\noccurs between the scapula and the chest wall. The rotator \\ncuff muscles are supraspinatus, subscapularis, teres minor and \\ninfraspinatus. They and their tendinous insertions help stability \\nand movement, especially abduction at the glenohumeral joint.\\nThe history\\nPain is common (Boxes 13.15 and 13.16) and frequently referred \\nto the upper arm. Glenohumeral pain may occur over the \\nanterolateral aspect of the upper arm. Pain felt at the shoulder \\nmay be referred from the cervical spine or diaphragmatic \\nand subdiaphragmatic peritoneum via the phrenic nerve. The \\nmost common cause of referred pain is cervical spondylosis, \\nwhere disc-space narrowing and osteophytes cause nerve root \\nimpingement and inflammation.\\n• Radial nerve (wrist and finger extensors): ask the patient to \\nextend the wrist and fingers fully (‘paper sign’).\\n• Ulnar nerve (hypothenar muscles, interossei, two medial \\nlumbricals, adductor pollicis, flexor carpi ulnaris and the \\nulnar half of flexor digitorum profundus): ask the patient to \\nmake the ‘scissors sign’.\\n•\\n Median nerve (thenar muscles that abduct and oppose the \\nthumb, the lateral two lumbricals, the medial half of flexor \\ndigitorum profundus, flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor \\ncarpi radialis, palmaris longus and pronator teres): ask the \\npatient to clench the fist fully (‘stone sign’). The best test \\nof median nerve motor function is the ability to abduct the \\nthumb away from the palm because of inconstant \\ncrossover in the nerve supply to the thenar eminence \\nmuscles other than abductor pollicis brevis. However, \\nclenching the fist fully also depends on median function \\nbecause of its flexor supply.\\n•\\n Anterior interosseous nerve (flexor pollicis longus, the index \\nfinger flexor digitorum profundus and pronator quadratus): \\nask the patient to make the ‘OK’ sign. This depends on \\nthe function of both flexor pollicis longus and index finger \\nflexor digitorum profundus.\\nExamining the wrist and hand with a wound\\nTest the tendons, nerves and circulation in a patient with a \\nwrist or hand wound. The wound site and the hand position at \\nthe time of injury indicate which structures may be damaged. \\nNormal movement may still be possible, however, even with \\n90% division of a tendon, so surgical exploration is needed for \\ncorrect diagnosis and treatment. Sensory aspects of nerve injury \\nare covered on page 142.\\nElbow\\nAnatomy and physiology\\nThe elbow joint has humeroulnar, radiocapitellar and superior \\nradioulnar articulations. The medial and lateral epicondyles are \\nthe flexor and extensor origins, respectively, for the forearm \\nmuscles. These two prominences and the tip of the olecranon \\nare easily palpated. They form an equilateral triangle when \\nthe elbow is flexed to 90 degrees, and lie in a straight line \\nwhen the elbow is fully extended. A subcutaneous bursa \\noverlies the olecranon and may become inflamed or infected \\n(bursitis). Elbow pain may be localised or referred from the \\nneck. Inflammatory arthritis and epicondylitis commonly cause  \\nelbow pain.\\nThe physical examination\\nExamination sequence\\nLook\\n• Look at the overall alignment of the extended elbow. There \\nis normally a valgus angle of 11–13 degrees with the \\nelbow fully extended (the ‘carrying angle’).\\n•\\n Look for:\\n• the swelling of synovitis between the lateral  \\nepicondyle and olecranon, resulting in a block to  \\nfull extension\\n• the rash of psoriasis, olecranon bursitis, tophi or \\nnodules\\n• rheumatoid nodules on the proximal extensor surface \\nof the forearm (see Fig. 13.7).'),\n",

The joint \\nis largely subcutaneous, allowing easy palpation of the patella, \\ntibial tuberosity, patellar tendon, tibial plateau margin and femoral \\ncondyles.

An effusion indicates intra-articular pathology. \\nHaemarthrosis (bleeding into the knee) is caused by injury to a \\nvascular structure within the joint, such as a torn cruciate ligament \\nor an intra-articular fracture. The menisci are predominantly \\navascular and do not cause a haemarthrosis, unless torn at their \\nperiphery, or in conjunction with some other internal derangement.\\nLocking\\nTwo common causes in the knee are a loose body, such \\nas from osteochondritis dissecans, osteoarthritis or synovial \\nchondromatosis, and a meniscal tear. Bucket-handle and anterior \\nbeak meniscal tears are especially associated with locking. \\nPosterior horn tears commonly cause pain and limit movement \\nin the last few degrees of flexion. Meniscal tears also cause local \\njoint-line tenderness. Congenital discoid meniscus may present \\nwith locking and clunking.\\nInstability (‘giving way’)\\nAny of the four main ligaments may rupture from trauma or \\nbecome incompetent with degenerative disease.

The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) \\nprevents anterior subluxation of the tibia on the femur, and the \\nposterior cruciate ligament resists posterior translation.

The safety of the patient, \\nother patients and staff is paramount, so your initial assessment \\nof an agitated or hostile patient may be only partial.\\nThe mental state examination\\nThe mental state examination (MSE) is a systematic evaluation \\nof the patient’s mental condition at the time of interview. The \\naim is to establish signs of mental disorder that, taken with the \\nhistory, enable you to make, suggest or exclude a diagnosis. \\nWhile making your specific enquiries, you need to observe, \\nevaluate and draw inferences in the light of the history. This is \\ndaunting, but with good teaching, practice and experience you \\nwill learn the skills.\\nThe MSE incorporates elements of the history, observation \\nof the patient, specific questions exploring various mental \\nphenomena and short tests of cognitive function. Like the history, \\nits focus is determined by the potential diagnoses. For example, \\ndetailed cognitive assessment in an elderly patient presenting \\nwith confusion is crucial; similarly, you should carefully evaluate \\nmood and suicidal thoughts when the presenting problem is \\ndepression.\\nAppearance\\nThink of this as a written account of a still photograph, prepared \\nfor someone who cannot see it.

Psychiatric \\nassessment is therefore a required skill for all clinicians. It consists \\nof four elements: the history, mental state examination, selective \\nphysical examination and collateral information. Each element can \\nbe expanded considerably, so the assessment must be adapted \\nto its purpose. Is it a quick screening of a patient presenting \\nwith other problems, a confirmation of a suspected diagnosis \\nor a comprehensive review for a second opinion?\\nThe history\\nGeneral approach\\nThe distinction between symptoms and signs is less clear in \\npsychiatry than in the rest of medicine. The psychiatric interview, \\nwhich covers both, has several purposes: to obtain a history of \\nsymptoms, to assess the present mental state for signs, and to \\nestablish rapport that will facilitate further management.\\nA comprehensive history covers a range of areas (Box 16.1), but \\nthe nature of the presenting problem and/or the referral question, \\nand the setting in which the history is being taken, will determine \\nthe degree of detail needed for each. When seeing someone in \\nthe accident and emergency department with a first episode of \\npsychosis, the focus is on symptoms, recent changes of function, \\nfamily history and drug use; when interviewing someone in an \\noutpatient clinic with a possible personality disorder, assessment \\nconcentrates instead on their personal history, which is essentially \\na systematised biography (Box 16.2).\\nSensitive topics\\nSome\\tsubjects\\trequire\\tparticular\\tskill.\\tThe\\tcommon\\ttheme\\tis\\t\\nreluctance to disclose, which can arise because the information \\nis private, and disclosure is potentially embarrassing (such as \\nsexual\\tdysfunction,\\tgender\\tidentity),\\tdistressing\\t(major\\ttraumatic\\t\\nexperiences, such as rape, childhood sexual abuse, witnessing a \\n16.1 Content of a psychiatric history\\n• Referral source\\n• Reason for referral\\n• History of presenting symptom(s)\\n• Systematic enquiry into other relevant problems and symptoms\\n• Past medical/psychiatric history\\n• Prescribed and non-prescribed medication\\n• Substance use: illegal drugs, alcohol, tobacco, caffeine\\n• Family history (including psychiatric disorders)\\n• Personal history\\n16.2 Personal history\\n• Childhood development\\n• Losses and experiences\\n• Education\\n• Occupation(s)\\n• Financial circumstances\\n• Relationships\\n• Partner(s) and children\\n• Housing\\n• Leisure activities\\n• Hobbies and interests\\n• Forensic history'),\n",

The most common are auditory and visual hallucinations, \\nthe former associated with schizophrenia and the latter with \\ndelirium. Some auditory hallucinations are characteristic of \\nschizophrenia, such as voices discussing the patient in the \\nthird person or giving a running commentary on the person’s \\nactivities (‘Now he’s opening the kitchen cupboard’). Ask, for \\nexample, ‘Do you ever hear voices when nobody is talking?’ \\nand ‘What do they say?’\\nPseudohallucinations are common. The key distinction from \\na true hallucination is that they occur within the patient, rather \\nthan arising externally. They have an ‘as if’ quality and lack the \\nvividness and reality of true hallucinations. Consequently, the \\naffected person is not usually distressed by them, and does \\nnot normally feel the need to respond, as often happens with \\ntrue hallucinations.\\nCognition\\nIf the history and observation suggest a cognitive deficit, it must \\nbe evaluated by standard tests. History, observation, MSE and \\nrating scales (see later) are then used together to diagnose and \\ndistinguish between the ‘3Ds’ (dementia, delirium and depression), \\nwhich are common in the elderly and in hospital inpatients.\\nCore cognitive functions include:\\n•\\t level\\tof\\tconsciousness\\n•\\t orientation\\n•\\t memory\\n•\\t attention\\tand\\tconcentration\\n•\\t intelligence.\\nLevel of consciousness\\nMental disorders are rarely associated with a reduced (or clouded) \\nlevel of consciousness, such as drowsiness, stupor or coma. \\nThe exception is delirium (which is both a physical and a mental \\ndisorder), where it is common.\\nOrientation\\nThis is a key aspect of cognitive function, being particularly \\nsensitive to impairment. Disorientation is the hallmark of \\nthe ‘organic mental state’ found in delirium and dementia. \\nAbnormalities may be evident during the interview but some \\npatients are adept at hiding them in social interactions. Check \\nthe patient’s orientation to time, place and person by evaluating \\ntheir knowledge of the current time and date, recognition of \\nwhere they are, and identification of familiar people.\\nMemory\\nMemory function is divided into three elements:\\n•\\t Registration\\tis\\ttested\\tby\\tasking\\tthe\\tpatient\\tto\\trepeat\\tafter\\t\\nyou\\tthe\\tnames\\tof\\tthree\\tunrelated\\tobjects\\t(apple,\\ttable,\\t\\npenny); any mistake is significant.

Sometimes the \\nrisk applies non-specifically to strangers, or to anyone preventing \\nthe patient from achieving their goals.\\nThere may be direct risk to life and limb (as in suicide, self-harm \\nor violence to others), or it may be an indirect risk, either to health \\n(through refusal of treatment for physical or mental illness) or \\nwelfare (through inability to provide basic care – food, warmth, \\nshelter, hygiene – for oneself or one’s dependents). The risk may \\nbe imminent, as in a patient actively attempting self-harm, or \\nremote, as in a patient refusing prophylactic medical treatment. \\nDirect risks tend to be imminent and indirect risks remote, although \\nthis is not always so. A patient declining renal dialysis because \\ntheir depression makes them feel unworthy is at imminent but \\nindirect risk of death. Finally, the likelihood of the risk may range \\nfrom near certainty to hypothetical possibility.\\nA risk assessment should readily distinguish between cases \\nwhere there is an imminent, direct and near-certain risk to the \\npatient’s life (such as a man actively trying to throw himself from \\nthe window to escape delusional persecutors), and those where \\nany risks apply to the welfare of other people, at some point \\nin the future, and amount to possibilities (such as a depressed \\nwoman who may be neglecting her frail elderly father). The former \\ncase calls for urgent intervention, probably via mental health \\nlegislation; the latter requires engagement over time, preferably \\nin a voluntary way.\\nWhile all psychiatric evaluations require some assessment of \\nrisk, it should be considered in depth whenever the presentation \\nincludes acts or threats of self-harm or reports of command \\nhallucinations, the past history includes self-harm or violent \\nbehaviour, the social circumstances show a recent, significant \\nloss, or the mental disorder is strongly associated with risk (as \\nin severe depression).\\nAssessing suicidality is the element of risk assessment that is \\nmost often needed.

Secondly, capacity is decision-specific: patients may not be \\nable to understand the risks and benefits of complex medical \\ntreatment options, while retaining the ability to decide whether \\nor not to enter a nursing home. Thirdly, residual capacity should \\nbe maximised: if a patient’s ability to understand is impaired by \\nsensory deficits or language barriers, these should be corrected \\nnew information; once this has registered, check retention \\nafter 5 minutes, with a distracting task in between. Do the \\nsame\\twith\\tthe\\tnames\\tof\\tthree\\tobjects;\\tany\\terror\\tis\\t\\nsignificant.

Gaps and mistakes are often obvious but some \\npatients may confabulate (that is, fill in the gaps with \\nplausible but unconsciously fabricated facts), so check the \\naccount with a family member or other informant if \\npossible. Confabulation is a core feature of Korsakoff’s \\nsyndrome, a complication of chronic alcoholism. Failing \\nlong-term memory is characteristic of dementia, although \\nthis store of knowledge can be remarkably intact in the \\npresence of severe impairment of other cognitive functions.\\nImpaired attention and concentration\\nThese occur in many mental disorders and are not diagnostic. \\nImpaired attention is observed as increased distractibility, with \\nthe patient responding inappropriately to intrusive internal events \\n(memories, obsessions, anxious ruminations) or to extraneous \\nstimuli, which may be either real (a noise outside the room) or \\nunreal (auditory hallucinations).\\nConcentration is the patient’s ability to persist with a mental \\ntask. It is tested by using simple, repetitive sequences, such as \\nasking the patient to repeat the months of the year or days of \\nthe week in reverse, or to do the ‘serial 7s’ test, in which 7 is \\nsubtracted from 100, then from 93, then 86 and so on.

It can be broken down into the recognition that abnormal \\nmental experiences are in fact abnormal, agreement that these \\nabnormalities amount to a mental illness, and acceptance of the \\nneed for treatment. Insight matters, since a lack of it often leads \\nto non-adherence, and sometimes to the need for compulsory \\ndetention.

The key principles here are to ensure that any treatment \\nproposed must benefit the patient and be the least restrictive \\noption available; it should take account of any wishes the patient \\nhas previously expressed, as well as the views of family members \\nand any other relevant others (such as nursing home staff).\\nThe physical examination\\nPhysical and mental disorders are associated, so always consider \\nthe physical dimension in any patient presenting with a psychiatric \\ndisorder, and vice versa.

Bear in mind that some physical disorders can present \\nwith psychiatric symptoms (such as thyrotoxicosis manifesting \\nas anxiety – look for exophthalmos, lid lag, goitre, tachycardia \\nand so on). For older patients with multiple medical problems, or \\nthose with alcohol dependence and associated physical harm, \\na more detailed examination is clearly needed.\\nIn primary care and acute hospital settings, patients will \\nusually undergo physical examination tailored to the presenting \\nproblem, but it is important to be aware that some psychiatric \\ndisorders can present with physical symptoms, such as chest \\npain and transient neurological symptoms as manifestations of \\npanic attacks.\\nCollateral history\\nCollateral history is important whenever assessment is limited by:\\n•\\t physical\\tillness,\\tacute\\tconfusional\\tstate\\tor\\tdementia\\n•\\t severe\\tlearning\\tdisability\\tor\\tother\\tmental\\tdisorder\\timpairing\\t\\ncommunication\\n•\\t disturbed,\\taggressive\\tor\\totherwise\\tuncooperative\\t\\nbehaviour.\\nSources of third-party information will usually include family and \\nother carers, as well as past and present general practitioners \\nand other health professionals.

As the \\ncombination of these factors is unique for each individual, their \\npresentations will be different. The first sign of new illness may \\nbe a change in functional status: typically, reduced mobility, \\naltered cognition or impairment of balance leading to falls. \\nCommon precipitants are infections, changes in medication and \\nmetabolic derangements but almost any acute medical insult can \\nproduce these non-specific presentations (Fig. 17.1). Each of \\nthese presentations should be explored through careful history \\ntaking, physical examination and functional assessment.\\nDisorders of cognition, communication and mood are so \\ncommon that they should always be considered at the start of \\nthe assessment of a frail older adult.\\nCommunication difficulties,  \\ncognition and mood\\nCommunication can be challenging (Box 17.2). The history \\ncan be incomplete, difficult to interpret or misleading, and the \\nwhole assessment, including physical examination, may be \\ntime-consuming.\\nWhenever possible, assess the patient somewhere quiet with \\nfew distractions. Make your patient comfortable and ensure they \\nunderstand the purpose of your contact. Provide any glasses, \\nhearing aids or dentures that they need and help them to switch \\nAssessment of the frail elderly patient\\nComprehensive geriatric assessment is an evidence-based \\nprocess that improves outcomes. It involves taking the history \\nfrom the patient and, with the patient’s consent, from a carer \\nor relative, followed by a systematic assessment of:\\n•\\t cognitive\\tfunction\\tand\\tmood\\n•\\t nutrition\\tand\\thydration\\n•\\t skin\\n•\\t pain\\n•\\t continence\\n•\\t hearing\\tand\\tvision\\n•\\t functional\\tstatus.\\nThe extent and focus of the assessment depend on the clinical \\npresentation. In non-acute settings such as the general practice \\nor outpatient clinic or day hospital, focus on establishing what \\ndiseases are present, and also which functional impairments \\nand problems most affect the patient’s life.\\nIn acute settings such as following acute hospital referral, \\nfocus on what has changed or is new. Seek any new symptoms \\nor signs of illness and any changes from baseline physical or \\ncognitive function.\\nThe complexity of the problems presented, and the need for \\ncomprehensive and systematic analysis, mean that assessment \\nis divided into components undertaken at different times, by \\ndifferent members of the multiprofessional team (Box 17.1).\\nThere is no specific age at which a patient becomes \\n‘elderly’; although age over 65 years is commonly used as the \\ndefinition, this has no biological basis, and many patients who \\nare chronologically ‘elderly’ appear biologically and functionally \\nyounger, and vice versa.\\nFrailty becomes more common with advancing age and is \\nlikely to be a response to chronic disease and ageing itself. A frail \\nelderly person typically suffers multimorbidity (multiple illnesses) \\nand has associated polypharmacy (multiple medications). They \\noften have cognitive impairment, visual and hearing loss, low \\nbodyweight and poor mobility due to muscular weakness, unstable \\nbalance and poor exercise tolerance. Their general functional \\nreserve and the capacity of individual organs and physiological \\nsystems are impaired, making the individual vulnerable to the \\neffects of minor illness.\\n17.1 The multiprofessional team\\nProfessional Key roles in assessment of\\nPhysician Physical state, including diagnosis \\nand therapeutic intervention\\nPsychiatrist Cognition, mood and capacity\\nPhysiotherapist Mobility, balance, gait and falls risk\\nOccupational therapist Practical functional activities \\n(self-care and domestic)\\nNurse Skin health, nutrition and continence\\nDietician Nutrition\\nSpeech and language therapist Speech and swallowing\\nSocial worker Social care needs\\n,QIHFWLRQ 0HWDEROLF\\nSUREOHPV\\n'UXJV 2WKHU\\nSUHFLSLWDQWV\\n)XQFWLRQDO\\x03GHFRPSHQVDWLRQ\\x03RI\\x03WKH\\x03IUDLO\\x03HOGHUO\\\\\\x03DGXOW\\n'HOLULXP,PPRELOLW\\\\ )DOOV\\nFig. 17.1 Functional decompensation in frail elderly people.  \\n17.2 Communication difficulties: the seven Ds\\nProblem Comment/causes\\nDeafness Nerve or conductive\\nDysphasia Most commonly due to stroke disease but sometimes \\na feature of dementia\\nDysarthria Cerebrovascular disease, motor neurone disease, \\nParkinson’s disease\\nDysphonia Parkinson’s disease\\nDementia Global impairment of cognitive function\\nDelirium Impaired attention, disturbance of arousal and \\nperceptual disturbances\\nDepression May mimic dementia or delirium\"),\n",

If they still cannot \\nhear you clearly, use an electronic communicator, or if they \\ncan read easily, write down simple questions and instructions.\\nCognitive function includes the processes of perception, \\nattention, memory, reasoning, decision making and problem \\nsolving (p. 323). Cognitive impairment increases with age and has \\nimplications for assessment, treatment, consent and prognosis. \\nConsider cognitive impairment if a patient has limited ability to \\ncooperate with you, cannot recall their medical history or seems \\nto deny all symptoms, even when they are clearly unwell. Other \\nproblems, including impaired hearing, low mood or dysphasia, \\ncan mimic cognitive impairment. Some patients present with \\napparently good social skills or ‘façade’ and cover their impaired \\nmemory by diverting the conversation to another topic. Do not \\nascribe changes in cognition to age alone without excluding \\ndementia or delirium (p. 323).\\nDepression is common in frail elderly people and may be \\ndifficult to diagnose. Consider this if your patient struggles to \\nconcentrate, or is withdrawn or reluctant to interact. A formal \\npsychiatric assessment and corroborating history from a carer or \\nfriend may be valuable. Standardised rating scales are available \\nsuch as the Geriatric Depression Scale.\\nPatients are often fearful that they will be admitted to hospital \\nor not return home after admission, and may play down their \\nsymptoms or functional limitations. Always try to corroborate the \\nhistory from a carer, relative or friend, with the patient’s consent.\\nThe history\\nThe presenting symptoms\\nFrail elderly patients often have multiple symptoms. Take time \\nto detail each symptom, and separate those arising from new \\nacute illness from those due to background disabilities.\\nAsk:\\n•\\t How\\tlong\\thave\\tyou\\thad\\ta\\tparticular\\tsymptom?\\n•\\t Has\\tit\\tchanged\\trecently?\\n•\\t When\\twere\\tyou\\tlast\\ttotally\\tfree\\tof\\tthe\\tsymptom?\\nTry to establish what the patient’s symptoms, functional abilities \\nand mental status were before the new presenting problem. This \\nhelps set realistic goals for treatment and rehabilitation.\\nThe patient’s perspective may vary from yours, particularly \\nin acute settings. For example, a patient referred following \\nsudden loss of consciousness may be unconcerned by this \\nbut anxious about longstanding back pain. These symptoms \\nare not coincidental; if it is important to your patient, it should \\nbe important to you.\\nCommon presenting symptoms\\nDecreased mobility\\nAsk about:\\n•\\t the\\tpatient’s\\tusual\\tmobility,\\twhen\\tit\\tchanged\\tand\\tif\\tthe\\t\\nchange was abrupt\\n•\\t any\\tfalls\\n•\\t use\\tof\\twalking\\taids\\n•\\t history\\tof\\trecent\\thead\\tinjury,\\tfevers\\tor\\trigors,\\tdizziness\\tor\\t\\npoor balance\\n•\\t lower\\tlimb\\tweakness,\\tnumbness\\tor\\tparaesthesia\\n•\\t joint\\tpain,\\tespecially\\tin\\tthe\\tback,\\tneck\\tor\\tlower\\tlimbs'),\n",

This can occur at any stage of a patient’s \\nillness but is more common if the patient has been admitted \\nas an emergency, undergone surgery or spent time in a \\nhigh-dependency or intensive care setting. Common causes \\nfor deterioration include sepsis, bleeding, myocardial infarction, \\nhypoglycaemia and pulmonary embolism.\\nEarly assessment and intervention is required, as these patients \\nare at high risk of cardiac arrest; once this occurs, fewer than \\n20% of patients survive to hospital discharge.\\nVital signs\\nPhysiological observations are monitored routinely in patients who \\nare admitted to hospital. The vital signs that are measured include \\nheart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, \\ntemperature and level of consciousness. Additional monitoring \\nmay include urine output, pain assessment and blood glucose  \\ntesting.\\nEarly warning scores\\nVital signs are recorded using track-and-trigger systems in the \\nform of early warning scores designed to assess illness severity. \\nMeasurements are made of the patient’s respiratory rate, the \\nuse of oxygen therapy, oxygen saturation, temperature, heart \\nrate, blood pressure and level of consciousness, and points \\nare assigned for physiological derangement in each organ \\nsystem. Increased frequency of observations is recommended \\nfor patients with abnormal signs, and a rising score triggers a \\ngraded response.\\nIn the UK there is a validated track-and-trigger system, the \\nNational Early Warning Score (NEWS; Fig. 18.1). This system \\nwill trigger a graded response, due to either an aggregated high \\nscore or a single severe physiological derangement, with the \\nurgency and seniority of the team being summoned escalating \\nas the score rises (Box 18.1). For example, a NEWS score of \\nbetween 1 and 4 is escalated to the nurse in charge of the \\nward, a score of 5 or 6 (or a single observation scoring 3) is \\nescalated to the doctor covering the ward, and a score of 7 \\nshould be escalated to a senior doctor and discussed with the \\nsupervising consultant, with consideration of referral to a critical  \\ncare team.\\nThe early warning score is designed to complement clinical \\njudgement. If you or another member of your team is concerned \\nabout a patient, do not dismiss this instinct purely because \\nthe early warning score is low. A patient may just look unwell \\nor feel cold to the touch and, although these features are not \\ncaptured by the early warning scoring systems, they may signify \\nearly deterioration, particularly in young patients with greater \\nphysiological reserve.\\nNEWS Key\\n0123\\nSp02\\nDate:\\nTime:\\n≥25 3\\n2\\n1\\n3\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n3\\n2\\n2\\n1\\n1\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n2\\n2\\n1\\n1\\n1\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n3\\n21–24\\n12–20\\n9–11\\n≤8\\nDefaultChronic\\nHypoxia\\n≥96\\n≥39°\\n38°\\n37°\\n36°\\n≤35°\\n230\\n220\\n210\\n200\\n190\\n180\\n170\\n160\\n150\\n140\\n130\\n120\\n110\\n100\\n90\\n80\\n70\\n60\\n50\\n>140\\n130\\n120\\n110\\n100\\n90\\n80\\n70\\n60\\n50\\n40\\n30\\nRegular Y/N\\nAlert\\nV/P/U\\nNew confusion\\nUrine output recorded Y/N\\nBlood Glucose\\nFrequency of observations\\nStructured Response Tool Y/N\\nEscalation Y/N\\nPain score (0–10)\\nNausea score (0–3)\\nMotor Block score (0–3)\\nCirculation\\nSensation\\nMovement\\nInitials\\nTotal NEWS score\\nUnrecordable\\n≥88 94–95Medical signature\\nrequired to use scale\\nfor patients with\\nChronic Hypoxia\\nSign\\n92–9386–87\\n≤91≤85\\nUnrecordable\\n%Inspired 02\\nTemperature\\nMark  •\\nNEWS\\nSCORE\\nuses\\nSystolic BP\\nManual\\nBP\\nMark\\nHeart Rate\\nConscious\\nLevel\\nRespiratory\\nRate\\nFig. 18.1 An example of a National Early Warning Score (NEWS) \\nchart.

If a family member or friend is present, \\nthey can provide valuable additional information and also support \\nthe patient. If the patient cannot provide information, contact \\nsomeone who knows them such as their general practitioner. Find \\nout what the person and their family know about their condition \\nand what their hopes, fears and expectations of treatment are. \\nThe key questions to ask are shown in Box 19.1.\\nIt is also helpful to ask yourself the ‘surprise question’: ‘Would \\nyou be surprised if this person died in the next few months, \\nweeks or days?’ If the answer is no, then it is time to find out \\nwhat things matter most to the patient and how they and their \\nfamily can best be supported during this time.\\nThe physical examination\\nPeople may retain some awareness, even when close to death. \\nSpeak to the patient by name and to others in the room as you \\nwould when your patient is awake.

Explain what to expect \\nwhen the person dies and what to do if the person is at home. \\nMost people stop breathing gradually but may take a final breath \\nafter a long pause. A brief muscle spasm may be observed at \\nthat time, so warn relatives about this.\\nConfirming and certifying death\\nThe confirmation and certification of death are important to allow \\nthe legal requirements and cultural and religious traditions that \\nhappen after a person has died to be fulfilled. Some people will \\nhave decided to be organ donors. Notification of the relevant \\nteam in advance and the prompt diagnosis of death can make \\nthis possible for many of them.\\nIn the UK death is defined as ‘the irreversible loss of the essential \\ncharacteristics necessary to the existence of a living person – to \\nbe able to sense and interact with the environment and to maintain \\nthe fundamental bodily functions of respiration and circulation’.\\nConsciousness and respiratory and circulatory function are \\ncontrolled within the brainstem. Irreversible damage to the \\nbrainstem, either after cardiorespiratory arrest or due to direct \\ndamage to the brainstem itself, always results in death.\\nThe history\\nA decision will usually have been made and documented in \\nadvance, stating that CPR will not be given because it would \\nnot work or would have a very poor outcome for this person. \\nOccasionally, a person with one or more advanced illnesses \\ndeteriorates more rapidly than expected or a decision that CPR will \\nnot be given has not been made in advance. In those situations \\nthe professionals who are present decide if CPR should not start \\nor should be stopped.\\nIf you are not familiar with the patient and their recent medical \\nhistory, read their records before going to see them or speaking \\nto their family. Being aware of whether the death was sudden or \\nexpected and how the person has been during their final illness \\nhelps you to prepare for speaking with the family.\\nThe physical examination\\nAfter the person has died, it is important for the clinical team to \\ncontinue to care for them as they would any other patient. This \\nincludes speaking about the person by name to family members \\nwho are present at the time of death or while you are carrying \\nout the examination to confirm death. Some relatives choose \\nto remain in the room and you need to explain each part of the \\nexamination in simple terms and conduct it in a respectful and \\nprofessional manner.\\nThe person who has died should be observed for a minimum \\nof 5 minutes to establish that irreversible cardiorespiratory arrest \\nhas occurred. This provides an opportunity for you to spend \\ntime supporting and listening to any family members who are \\npresent. After death the body cools gradually and stiffens; bowel \\nsounds may persist for a time until the sphincters relax and the \\nbowels and bladder empty.\\nBrainstem death\\nThe diagnosis of brainstem death must be made by at least two \\ndoctors who have been fully registered for at least 5 years. They \\nCare in the last days of life\\nIf the patient is likely to die soon, their care needs to be planned \\nto anticipate problems. It is important to review a patient who is \\ndying at least daily, and more often if they are unsettled or have \\ncomplex clinical problems. If a patient deteriorates rapidly or their \\nsymptoms change, urgent assessment is required. Find out if \\nthe other people who are caring for the dying patient have any \\nconcerns and work with them to maintain the person’s comfort \\nand dignity. Involve and support family members and close friends.\\nCultural, religious and spiritual care is very important when \\na person is dying, at the time of death and afterwards. Always \\nask the person and those close to them about their wishes and \\nwhat you and other staff members can do to help support them. \\nThis may include wishes about how the person is touched or \\ncared for after death.\\nCommunication with patients and families\\nFind out what the patient and their family know and what they \\nexpect.

Modern assessment \\nmethods such as OSCEs and clinical simulation allow assessment \\nof knowledge, skills and attitudes in an integrated manner and can \\npermit candidates to demonstrate a higher level of performance \\nthrough ‘showing how’ and ‘doing’ (Fig. 20.1).\\nAssessments are linked to the learning outcomes of a course or \\ncurriculum, and ‘blueprinting’ is used to ensure there is appropriate \\ncoverage of the required knowledge, skills and behaviours across \\nthe examination. In order to perform well in clinical assessments, \\nit is therefore crucial that you familiarise yourself with both the \\ncurriculum and the domains or skills on which you are being \\nassessed. Not all skills will be assessed at each examination \\n(Box 20.2).\\nOnce you have achieved a level of competence in a clinical \\nskill or domain, you may be considered to be ‘entrustable’ in this \\nprofessional activity. For example, a final-year medical student \\nmay be ‘entrusted’ to perform peripheral cannulation on a patient \\nif they have demonstrated competence in the specified domains \\n(such as obtaining consent from a patient for the procedure and \\ntechnical competence in the procedure itself).\\nGeneral principles\\nClinical assessments are integral to undergraduate and \\npostgraduate medical education and training, and are designed \\nto verify that those involved in the care of patients meet safe \\nclinical standards. Assessments can be formative and/or \\nsummative. Formative assessments (such as workplace-based \\nassessments) allow you to receive feedback on and monitor your \\nown performance. Assessments such as these can be highly \\neffective adjuncts to learning if they promote reflection on your \\nown performance and recognition of areas for improvement \\nand further development. Summative assessments, on the \\nother hand, are used to evaluate whether you have achieved a \\nrequired competence or standard in terms of knowledge, skills \\nor performance, which may be set by licensing bodies such as \\nthe General Medical Council in the UK or postgraduate colleges. \\nAssessment can also be used to provide evidence of safe practice: \\nfor example, simulation assessments for doctors in difficulty, or \\nfor recruitment and selection into specialty training.\\nThis chapter provides an overview of the spectrum of clinical \\nassessment methods, with a particular emphasis on objective \\nstructured clinical examinations (OSCEs) and clinical simulation \\nscenarios. Guidance is offered on how to prepare for formal \\nassessment, including the role of deliberate rehearsal, along \\nwith hints for optimising your performance in clinical and \\ncommunication skills assessment.\\nMethods of assessment\\nThe most widely used clinical assessment methods include \\nOSCEs, short cases, long cases and clinical simulation scenarios \\n(Box 20.1), during which you may be observed performing an \\nintegrated sequence of clinical, practical and/or communication \\nskills.\\nDifferent assessment formats test different aspects of your \\nprofessional competence or expertise.

Experiential learning such as this (‘learning by doing’) also \\nsupports the transition from theory to practice. Clinical simulation \\nis commonly included in both undergraduate and postgraduate \\nassessments to evaluate a candidate’s ability to integrate a \\nnumber of complex skills or domains, which may include clinical \\nexamination, practical skills and drug or fluid prescribing. Often the \\nscenario will involve an acutely unwell patient who is experiencing \\na medical emergency such as life-threatening asthma, where \\nthe use of a real patient is not feasible (Box 20.3). The patient \\nmannequin is set up in a realistic clinical environment (such as \\na simulated ward), with real props and equipment (such as a \\nnebuliser mask), and there is often an additional member of staff \\nin the room (playing the role of the nurse, for example) who can \\nperform tasks and provide results of investigations if requested \\nby the candidate. Sometimes a facilitator may also be the \\n‘voice’ of the patient, giving important prompts (‘I can’t breathe’ \\nor simulating audible wheeze). The examination brief will clarify \\nwhat is expected of you during the station but it is likely that you \\nwill be assessed on your competence in physical assessment, \\ncommunication skills and the initial management of the patient.\\nOSCEs\\nThese are widely used in undergraduate and postgraduate assess-\\nments, and are commonly designed to assess communication/\\nconsultation skills, practical skills, examination skills or an inte -\\ngrated combination of all of these. OSCEs consist of multiple \\nclinical encounters or ‘stations’ (generally between 6 and 12). \\nCandidates rotate through each station, which will be assigned \\na fixed duration (usually 8–12 minutes).\\nOSCEs may use a combination of real patients with good \\nclinical signs, simulated patients who often participate in the \\ncommunication skills stations, simulation mannequins (who may \\nbe put in the role of an acutely unwell patient where using a real \\npatient is not feasible or safe) and/or part-task trainers (lifelike \\nmodels of body parts) for assessment of procedural skills such \\nas venepuncture (Box 20.4).\\nMarking structures\\nExaminers award marks for your performance in assessments \\nusing a standardised marking structure.

These checklists \\nare commonly used in OSCE stations, where the assessment \\nis broken down into its individual components (for example, \\n‘Introduces self to patient’), each component is allocated a \\nrange of marks, and your score is calculated as the sum of \\nthe component marks (Box 20.4). Often a significant number \\nof marks will be allocated to generic aspects of the encounter \\n(such as hand washing, obtaining consent to proceed, and \\ndemonstrating kindness and respect). There may also be some \\nelements of the OSCE that are mandatory in order to achieve \\na pass (such as administering oxygen to a simulated patient \\nwith acute asthma, or addressing the patient’s concerns in a \\ncommunications station). By familiarising yourself with the marking \\nstructure for the examination, you can ensure that you tailor your \\npreparation to maximise your chance of success.\\nAnother common examination marking approach is the use \\nof global judgement scores. Global judgements are awarded \\nas an overall rating of performance or competence in particular \\ndomains or distinct observed behaviours (such as ‘Identifying \\nclinical signs’ or ‘Maintaining patient welfare’, see Box 20.3). \\nWhen global assessment is used, usually two or more examiners \\nwill independently mark the candidate. If the assessment has \\nincluded a simulated or real patient, they may also be asked for \\ntheir global judgement of your performance.\\nApproach to preparation\\nMake sure that you start to prepare well in advance and familiarise \\nyourself with the format of the assessment: know how many \\nstations there are, how long you have for each station and what \\ndomains or skills are being assessed. Most institutions will readily \\ntell you what is expected from a candidate in order to pass each \\nstation, and there may be useful information available online. For \\nexample, to achieve a pass in a physical examination OSCE you \\nmay be required to perform a systematic examination, correctly \\nidentify the physical signs, create a sensible differential diagnosis \\nand suggest an appropriate initial management plan. Remember \\nthat assessments are ‘blueprinted’ (that is, they will be mapped \\nto the learning outcomes from your curriculum; Box 20.2) and \\nyou should therefore use the curriculum to guide your learning.\\nTo some extent, the cases you are likely to be presented with \\nin an examination can be predicted. Institutions will typically \\nhave a cohort of volunteer patients with common chronic stable \\ndiseases (such as pulmonary fibrosis or a renal transplant) or \\npathognomonic signs (retinitis pigmentosa or acromegaly), who \\nhave volunteered to participate. These patients may have helped \\nin examinations before and will be well prepared to cooperate \\nwith your physical assessment. It is unusual to be asked to \\nexamine a patient who is acutely unwell, and therefore conditions \\nsuch as severe asthma or pulmonary oedema will usually be \\ntested only in simulated scenarios. Remember that there are \\ncertain rare conditions, many of which are covered in earlier \\nsections of this book, that may be over-represented in certain \\nexaminations. Where possible, speak to other candidates who \\nhave sat the examination in the past, or refer to past papers or \\nrevision aids where they exist.\\nTake every opportunity you can to practise what will be expected \\nof you on the day, informally with peers or more formally in \\npreparatory courses if these are available to you.

On inspection of the \\nchest there is no evidence of scars, the apex beat is palpable in the \\nfifth intercostal space and there are no thrills or heaves. On \\nauscultation, the heart sounds are normal and there is a grade 3/6 \\nejection systolic murmur, loudest over the aortic area and radiating to \\nthe carotids. To conclude my examination I would like to measure the \\nblood pressure, listen to the lung bases, check for peripheral oedema \\nand assess peripheral pulses. The most likely diagnosis in this patient \\nis that of aortic stenosis.\\nObserving local dress and infection control policies. \\ndown and to have long hair tied back. Ensure that you have the \\nappropriate clinical equipment with you (such as stethoscope, pen \\ntorch and so on) and are familiar with their use. If you are going \\nto have physical contact with a patient during the assessment, \\nalways clean your hands with alcohol-based gel or soap and water \\n(see Fig. 3.1) and observe basic safety principles, including the \\nuse of personal protective equipment and safe sharps disposal.\\nManaging time\\nManaging your time, both in advance of and during the \\nassessment, can have a major impact on your performance. \\nMake sure that you know where the examination is to be held, \\nrehearse your journey and give yourself plenty of time to get  \\nthere.\\nPay particular attention to the timings within the examination \\nand ensure that you have practised completing your assessment \\nwithin the allocated time. Some assessments will be broken into \\ndifferent stages, and it is worth finding out as much as you can \\nabout the format; you may think you have 10 minutes to complete \\nthe OSCE station but in reality you may be allowed to spend only \\npart of the time with the patient with the remaining time reserved \\nfor questioning from the examiners. Marks will be awarded for \\nyour answers to these questions. If you take too long assessing \\nthe patient, you may not be able to take advantage of these \\nmarks; similarly, if you finish your assessment too quickly, you \\nrisk the examiners moving on to more challenging questions to \\nfill the remaining time. Assessments will often have short breaks \\nbetween stations to allow candidates to read the instructions for \\nthe next station; once again, it is helpful to familiarise yourself \\nwith these aspects of the examination in advance.\\nCommunication during assessment\\nIt is vital in any assessment that you communicate with the \\nexaminers and patients in a polite and professional manner, as \\nyou would in real clinical practice. Always obtain consent from \\nthe patient to be examined, be sure not to cause any physical \\ndiscomfort and thank them at the end of the station. Examiners \\nwill be assessing your communication skills and bedside manner, \\nas well as your clinical examination technique.\\nListen carefully to the instructions from the examiners, as these \\nare often very specific (‘Examine this patient’s precordium’). You \\nmay also be told whether you should present your findings as \\nyou go along or at the end of your examination. When presenting \\nyour clinical findings, try to sound confident about them, avoid \\nusing language that indicates uncertainty in your own abilities (‘I \\nthink I heard a systolic murmur’ does not fill an examiner with \\nconfidence) and never report findings that you have not actually \\nelicited. Use a succinct and structured format when presenting, \\nhighlighting important positive findings and describing only the \\nrelevant negative findings (see Box 20.5); listing all negatives \\nwastes valuable time. If there is an obvious abnormality (such \\nas a patient who is jaundiced), it is sensible to mention this early \\nin your case presentation so that examiners see that you have \\nnoted the important finding. Do not expect any feedback from your \\nexaminers at the end of each station, as generally they are asked \\nto avoid giving you an indication of how you have performed.\\nIn communication stations involving simulated patients, you \\nmay be asked to take a focused history or to discuss a specific \\nissue such as consent, or to break some difficult news.

Sometimes doctors instantly recognise \\na condition based on previous experience (‘spot diagnoses’, \\np. 34). Visual patterns are particularly likely to lead to such \\nrecognition: for example, a typical rash. More commonly, elements \\nof the history and examination together trigger pattern recognition. \\nThis process relies on comparing a patient’s presentation to cases \\nencountered before and remembered as ‘illness scripts’. With \\nincreasing experience, less typical presentations are encountered \\nand recalled, and doctors are increasingly able to recognise \\nmore exceptional cases.\\nPre-test probability\\nWhere doctors are unable to recognise patterns in presentations \\nquickly, various refinement strategies are used to arrange the \\npossible diagnoses in order of probability. The pre-test probability \\nof a disease in an individual depends on the context in which \\nthe symptom has appeared because the prevalence of disease \\nvaries between populations. In general practice populations the \\nincidence of serious disease is much lower than in hospital \\npopulations; serious conditions still usually need to be excluded, \\nhowever. This may involve identification of ‘red flag’ symptoms \\nand signs for serious disease, or the use of clinical prediction \\nrules such as the Wells score for deep vein thrombosis. Positive \\n‘red flag’ features or above-threshold prediction scores increase \\nthe probability of a disease in individuals and generally trigger \\nfurther investigations.\\nAdditional factors affecting the pre-test probability of disease in \\npatients with the same presenting symptoms include age, gender, \\npast medical history, family history and lifestyle. Few doctors use \\nformal probabilistic reasoning in making diagnoses, but most \\nknow the relationship between these factors and the likelihood \\nof a specific disease and use this understanding intuitively to \\nselect likely diagnoses (hypotheticodeductive reasoning, Fig. \\n21.1). History, examination and investigation results are used \\nto support or refute putative diagnoses. These components are \\nrarely independent, however, and returning to clarify the history \\nor re-examine when signs are ambiguous allows an iterative \\napproach to accurate diagnosis.\\nRare diseases\\nWhile diagnosis by probability works in most cases, rare diseases \\nalso occur, and to the affected patients and their families they are \\nnot rare. Avoid the trap of thinking that all patients have common \\nconditions and that symptoms that do not fit with common \\ndiagnoses are less important. Indeed, occasional patients with \\na credible and consistent history of unusual symptoms may actually \\nmerit more, not less, investigation. The art is to listen carefully, \\nkeep an open mind, and pick up the uncommon situation when the \\nusual patterns of presentation really do not fit the facts of a case.\\nOther factors that complicate the application of clinical skills \\nin diagnosis include:\\n•\\t clinical\\tproblems\\tinvolving\\tmany\\torgan\\tsystems\\trather\\t \\nthan one\\n•\\t new\\tdisease\\toccurring\\tin\\tthe\\tcontext\\tof\\texisting\\tphysical\\t\\nand psychological comorbidities\\nThe transition from medical student to junior doctor culminates in \\nindependent practice in a variety of clinical settings. This chapter \\naddresses how the clinical skills described in this book are used \\nand adapted in everyday practice.\\nWhatever the setting, the doctor’s task is to translate \\npatients’ problems into diagnoses, therapeutic possibilities and \\nprognoses. Undergraduate medical students first learn history \\ntaking, examination and investigation as a logical sequence, \\nas described in preceding chapters. In reality, however, the \\napplication of these skills to a patient’s clinical problem is often \\na less ordered, more nuanced process.\\nAdapting history and examination \\nskills appropriately\\nHistory and examination skills are adapted by doctors to suit the \\nsituation. For example, elective surgical or unscheduled emergency \\nadmissions may require a systematic and comprehensive history \\nand examination. Patients attending a specialist outpatient clinic, \\nwill already have been screened by a referring clinician, however, \\nand a history and examination focused on the presenting condition \\nis appropriate. If the patient is attending a review clinic, history and \\nexamination may be restricted to monitoring an existing condition. \\nThe information-gathering process may appear to be sequential: \\nthe history suggests a differential diagnosis; examination and \\nthen investigation help confirm or refute diagnostic possibilities. \\nIn reality, these elements often occur in parallel. For example, \\nsequential history then examination may be abandoned in \\nfavour of a more opportunistic approach to avoid distressing \\na reluctant child. In critically ill patients a highly focused history \\nand examination aimed at rapidly identifying the main problems \\nwhile initiating resuscitation is imperative.\\nIntegrated examination\\nAlthough in an individual it is rarely necessary to carry out a \\ncomprehensive history and examination of all systems, a rapid \\nscreening examination may be useful to direct more detailed \\nexamination if the diagnosis is unclear or when patients are \\nbeing admitted to hospital. There is no single correct procedure \\nfor performing a physical examination and you will develop your \\nown approach, but a reasonable routine is outlined in Box 21.1.\\n21.1 A personal system for performing a  \\nphysical examination\\n• Handshake and introduction\\n• Note general appearances \\nwhile talking:\\n• Does the patient look well?\\n• Any immediate and obvious \\nclues, e.g. obesity, \\nplethora, breathlessness\\n•\\n Complexion\\n• Hands and radial pulse\\n• Face\\n• Mouth and ears\\n• Neck\\n• Thorax:\\n• Breasts\\n• Heart\\n• Lungs\\n• Abdomen\\n• Lower limbs:\\n• Oedema\\n• Circulation\\n• Locomotor function and \\nneurology\\n• Upper limbs:\\n• Movement and neurology\\n• Cranial nerves, including \\nfundoscopy\\n• Blood pressure\\n• Temperature\\n• Height and weight\\n• Urinalysis'),\n",

Remember that patients with \\nMUS may also have or develop disease. Even if a functional \\ndiagnosis is suspected, a comprehensive history and examination \\nremain imperative. This helps patients to feel that they are being \\ntaken seriously; in addition, organic disease, however unlikely, \\nis less likely to be missed.\\nPatients’ illness beliefs matter hugely and should be explicitly \\nacknowledged. What do they think is wrong? Why have they \\ncome to you now and what do they hope you can do for them? \\nInconsistencies in the history should be explored with the patient; \\nfor example, a patient with severe chest pain and normal coronary \\nangiography may still firmly believe they have angina. Normal \\ninvestigations need to be explained clearly to help demonstrate \\nthat the evidence does not support their belief.\\nPatients may complain about previous doctors or treatments. \\nAllowing a patient to express dissatisfaction shows interest, and \\nhelps to avoid suggesting treatments they are likely to reject. \\nAlways remain professional and avoid being drawn into criticism \\nof other healthcare providers.\\nPatients can be acutely sensitive to questions that suggest a \\ndoctor thinks there is a psychological basis for their symptoms \\n(‘all in the mind’). Frame questions carefully in terms of their \\nsymptoms: for example, ‘Do your symptoms ever make you feel \\ndown or frustrated?’ rather than ‘Do you ever feel depressed?’ \\nAbuse is one possible precipitant of MUS but seek this history \\njudiciously. Follow local guidelines for any abuse you discover.\\nThe physical assessment includes observing the patient \\nthroughout the consultation.

Symptoms are not synonymous with disease, however, \\nbut are subjective experiences with many possible sources: \\npathological, physiological, psychological, cultural, behavioural \\nand external. Many patients experience symptoms that impair \\nfunction but do not fit characteristic patterns of disease, and \\npersist despite normal examination and investigations. These are \\ncalled ‘functional’ or ‘medically unexplained symptoms’ (MUS, Fig. \\n21.2). Over 30% of patients attending their general practitioner \\nhave MUS and they are also common in secondary care, although \\ndisease prevalence is much higher there. Some symptoms are \\nmore likely to be medically unexplained than others: for example, \\npersistent fatigue, abdominal pain and back pain. The causes \\nof MUS are poorly understood but various predisposing and \\nprecipitating factors (Box 21.2) may contribute. Most functional \\nsymptoms are transient but some become persistent, causing \\nsimilar disability to those resulting from disease and also significant \\nemotional distress. If MUS are not recognised and managed \\nappropriately, attempts to alleviate them can result in harm from \\nfruitless investigations, inappropriate interventions or drugs, and \\nincreased fear of disease.\\nPatients with MUS commonly feel that doctors do not think \\ntheir symptoms are real, leading to a breakdown in trust between \\npatient and doctor, and frustration for both. Crucially, doctors \\nmust use an empathic and non-judgemental approach so the \\npatient feels believed. Keep an open mind and accept all the'),\n",

Examination and interventions often \\noccur simultaneously as the clinician attempts to identify the \\nmain problems. Initially, your aim is to gain control of the situation \\nand stabilise the patient’s condition. A fuller history and clinical \\nexamination can follow after initial resuscitation.\\nThe approach to recognising and assessing the acutely ill and \\ndeteriorating patient is covered in detail in Chapter 18.\\nDocumenting your findings\\nDocumenting clinical findings in a clear and concise medical \\nrecord is a crucial aspect of medical practice. It should include \\na structured account of the history and examination – both \\npositive and important negative findings. Some circumstances \\ndemand additional detail: for example, forensic documentation \\nof the length and position of wounds.\\nThe appropriate level of detail varies with the context but adopt \\nand use a consistent format. This format quickly becomes a habit, \\nreduces your need to think about what to record next, and lessens \\nthe likelihood of forgetting something important. A consistent \\nformat also allows others to locate specific information quickly \\nin your documentation. An example of clear and comprehensive \\nclinical documentation of a case is shown in Fig. 21.3.\\nOne widely used overall structure for organising your written \\ndocumentation is SOAP, an acronym for subjective, objective, \\nassessment and plan.\\nSubjective\\nThis records information you obtain directly from the patient (or \\nsomeone speaking on their behalf). It constitutes the body of \\nthe history, as covered in Chapter 2. What is the patient’s chief \\nsymptom? What is the patient’s current condition? It is best \\nto avoid describing the problem in medical terms at this point \\nand more useful to record the patient’s own words. What is the \\nhistory of the problem? If an injury, what was the mechanism?\\nPast medical history, family medical history, social history \\n(including smoking and alcohol or recreational drug use), current \\nmedications and any allergies should also be noted here.\\nObjective\\nThis is information you gather about the patient. Here you record \\nvital signs, findings from your physical examination and the results \\nof any initial investigations. Again, it is useful to use a standard \\nformat to record physical findings, so others can find specific \\ninformation quickly.\\nAssessment\\nThis starts with a brief summary of the information obtained. It \\nthen lists the patient’s main symptoms, together with a differential \\ndiagnosis. If the patient has several pressing issues, compile a \\n‘problem list’. Not all of these problems may be medical but they \\nwill all influence the best plan for what to do next. For example, \\n‘worsening soft-tissue infection of the left lower leg’ is a problem \\nwith a diagnosis, but ‘not taken any of the prescribed antibiotics \\nbut some non-pathological signs are associated with MUS; for \\ninstance, in irritable bowel syndrome you may find evidence of \\nbloating and some tenderness, but otherwise gastrointestinal \\nexamination will be normal. The history often suggests MUS, so \\nfocus on excluding any unexpected physical findings, as well as \\ndemonstrating to patients that you are taking them seriously. Any \\nsigns you do find may vary between examinations but overall \\nthe examination is commonly normal with MUS.\\nInvestigations are used in MUS mainly to reassure both \\nphysician and patient. Exhaustive investigations to exclude all \\nphysical illness are costly and unhelpful, risk side effects and \\ndo not reassure patients in the longer term. Before requesting \\ninvestigations, discuss with the patient the likelihood and \\nsignificance of a normal result. Patients are more likely to be \\nsatisfied when your explanation makes sense to them, removes \\nblame and helps generate ideas about how they can manage \\ntheir symptoms.\\nAssessment of a patient with minor \\ninjury or illness\\nIn patients with minor injury or illness, usually presenting in the \\naccident and emergency department or general practice, a history \\nand examination focused on the presenting symptoms are usually \\nsufficient. It is, however, crucial to establish the reason for the \\npatient’s presentation, as well as clearly defining their clinical \\nproblem, as their concerns about their symptoms and their \\nexpectations of investigation and treatment influence the outcome.\\nCarefully eliciting the mechanism of injury, progression of \\nsymptoms and their impact on the patient (for example, whether \\nthey can walk and go to work/school) will help detect problems \\nthat are not as ‘minor’ as they might seem. Be wary of the \\napparently minor injury or illness that is actually the tip of a \\ndiagnostic iceberg, for example:\\n•\\t a\\tclavicular\\tfracture\\tcaused\\tby\\tminimal\\ttrauma,\\twhich\\tis\\tin\\t\\nfact a pathological fracture secondary to an underlying \\nlung malignancy\\n•\\t a\\tfall\\twith\\twrist\\tinjury\\tthat\\twas\\tactually\\ta\\tsyncopal\\tepisode\\t\\ncaused by cardiac arrhythmia\\n•\\t shoulder\\tpain\\tthat\\tinitially\\tsounds\\tmusculoskeletal\\tbut\\tis\\tin\\t\\nfact the first presentation of angina\\n•\\t a\\tpattern\\tof\\tsoft-tissue\\tinjury\\tin\\ta\\ttoddler\\tthat\\tis\\tcompletely\\t\\nat odds with the history, suggesting possible \\nnon-accidental injury.\\nFocus your examination on the system or body part implicated \\nin the history, as outlined in previous chapters. If the findings \\nare not consistent, carry out a more comprehensive history and \\nexamination. If the system affected is unclear (such as arm pain, \\nwhich may be musculoskeletal, vascular, neurological or referred \\ncardiac pain), examine all of these systems.\\nAs you formulate a differential diagnosis, check for other \\nsystemic features of disease in addition to examining the \\nobvious source of symptoms. A swollen ankle may trigger a \\nsystematic enquiry and examination if the history suggests a \\nreactive arthropathy rather than a simple sprain.\\nFocusing the clinical examination comes with practice, but \\nif in doubt, be comprehensive. Start with the body part that \\nis causing the most trouble and follow leads. Elements of the \\nexamination likely to cause discomfort should be left until last.\\nA careful and courteous examination can also increase trust \\nbetween the patient and clinician. Even when you feel it is unlikely \\nto yield important information, examination reassures the patient'),\n",

He had major interests in rheumatology and medical education. \\nMedical students who attended his clinical teaching sessions remember him as \\nan inspirational teacher with the ability to present complex problems with great \\nclarity. He was invariably courteous to his patients and students alike. He had an \\nuncanny knack of involving all students equally in clinical discussions and used \\npraise rather than criticism. He paid great attention to the value of history taking \\nand, from this, expected students to identify what particular aspects of the physical \\nexamination should help to narrow the diagnostic options.\\nHis consultant colleagues at the Western welcomed the opportunity of contributing \\nwhen he suggested writing a textbook on clinical examination. The book was first \\npublished in 1964 and John Macleod edited seven editions. With characteristic \\nmodesty he was very embarrassed when the eighth edition was renamed Macleod’s \\nClinical Examination. This, however, was a small way of recognising his enormous \\ncontribution to medical education.\\nHe possessed the essential quality of a successful editor – the skill of changing \\ndisparate contributions from individual contributors into a uniform style and format \\nwithout causing offence; everybody accepted his authority.

These time-honoured \\nskills can often allow clinicians to reach a clear diagnosis without \\nrecourse to expensive and potentially harmful tests.\\nThis book aims to assist clinicians in developing the consultation \\nskills required to elicit a clear history, and the practical skills \\nneeded to detect clinical signs of disease. Where possible, the \\nphysical basis of clinical signs is explained to aid understanding. \\nFormulation of a differential diagnosis from the information gained \\nis introduced, and the logical initial investigations are included for \\neach system. Macleod’s Clinical Examination is designed to be \\nused in conjunction with more detailed texts on pathophysiology, \\ndifferential diagnosis and clinical medicine, illustrating specifically \\nhow the history and examination can inform the diagnostic \\nprocess.\\nIn this edition the contents have been restructured and the \\ntext comprehensively updated by a team of existing and new \\nauthors, with the aim of creating an accessible and user-friendly \\ntext relevant to the practice of medicine in the 21st century.\\nSection 1 addresses the general principles of good interaction \\nwith patients, from the basics of taking a history and examining, \\nto the use of pattern recognition to identify spot diagnoses. \\nSection 2 deals with symptoms and signs in specific systems \\nand Section 3 illustrates the application of these skills to specific \\nclinical situations. Section 4 covers preparation for assessments \\nof clinical skills and for the use of these skills in everyday practice.\\nAn expertly performed history and examination of a patient \\nallows the doctor to detect disease and predict prognosis, and is \\ncrucial to the principle of making the patient and their concerns \\ncentral to the care process, and also to the avoidance of harm \\nfrom unnecessary or unjustified tests.\\nWe hope that if young clinicians are encouraged to adopt \\nand adapt these skills, they not only will serve their patients \\nas diagnosticians but also will themselves continue to develop \\nclinical examination techniques and a better understanding of \\ntheir mechanisms and diagnostic use.\\nThe 14th edition of Macleod’s Clinical Examination  has an \\naccompanying set of videos available in the online Student \\nConsult electronic library. This book is closely integrated with \\nDavidson’s Principles and Practice of Medicine and is best read \\nin conjunction with that text.\\nJAI, ARD, KF\\nEdinburgh, 2018'),\n",

Examples of person-specific factors that reduce \\nthe propensity to consult include stoicism, self-reliance, guilt, \\nunwillingness to acknowledge psychological distress, and \\nembarrassment about lifestyle factors such as addictions. These \\nfactors may vary between patients and also in the same person \\nin different circumstances, and may be influenced by gender, \\neducation, social class and ethnicity.\\nThe clinical environment\\nYou should take all reasonable steps to ensure that the \\nconsultation is conducted in a calm, private environment. The \\nlayout of the consulting room is important and furniture should \\nbe arranged to put the patient at ease (Fig. 1.1A) by avoiding \\nface-to-face, confrontational positioning across a table and the \\nincursion of computer screens between patient and doctor (Fig. \\n1.1B). Personal mobile devices can also be intrusive if not used \\njudiciously.\\nFor hospital inpatients the environment is a challenge, yet \\nprivacy and dignity are always important. There may only be \\ncurtains around the bed space, which afford very little by way \\nof privacy for a conversation. If your patient is mobile, try to \\nuse a side room or interview room. If there is no alternative to \\nspeaking to patients at their bedside, let them know that you \\nunderstand your conversation may be overheard and give them \\npermission not to answer sensitive questions about which they \\nfeel uncomfortable.\\nThe clinical encounter\\nThe clinical encounter between a patient and doctor lies at the \\nheart of most medical practice. At its simplest, it is the means by \\nwhich people who are ill, or believe themselves to be ill, seek the \\nadvice of a doctor whom they trust. Traditionally, and still most \\noften, the clinical encounter is conducted face to face, although \\nnon-face-to-face or remote consultation using the telephone or \\ndigital technology is possible and increasingly common. This \\nchapter describes the general principles that underpin interactions \\nwith patients in a clinical environment.\\nReasons for the encounter\\nThe majority of people who experience symptoms of ill health \\ndo not seek professional advice. For the minority who do seek \\nhelp, the decision to consult is usually based on a complex \\ninterplay of physical, psychological and social factors (Box 1.1). \\nThe perceived seriousness of the symptoms and the severity of \\nthe illness experience are very important influences on whether \\npatients seek help. The anticipated severity of symptoms is \\ndetermined by their intensity, the patient’s familiarity with them, \\nand their duration and frequency. Beyond this, patients try to \\nmake sense of their symptoms within the context of their lives. \\nThey observe and evaluate their symptoms based on evidence \\nfrom their own experience and from information they have \\ngathered from a range of sources, including family and friends, \\nprint and broadcast media, and the internet. Patients who present \\nwith a symptom are significantly more likely to believe or worry \\nthat their symptom indicates a serious or fatal condition than \\nnon-consulters with similar symptoms; for example, a family \\nhistory of sudden death from heart disease may affect how a \\nperson interprets an episode of chest pain. Patients also weigh \\nup the relative costs (financial or other, such as inconvenience) \\nand benefits of consulting a doctor. The expectation of benefit \\nfrom a consultation – for example, in terms of symptom relief \\nor legitimisation of time off work – is a powerful predictor of \\nconsultation. There may also be times when other priorities in \\npatients’ lives are more important than their symptoms of ill health \\nand deter or delay consultation. It is important to consider the \\ntiming of the consultation. Why has the patient presented now? \\nSometimes it is not the experience of symptoms themselves that \\nprovokes consultation but something else in the patients’ lives \\nthat triggers them to seek help (Box 1.2).\\n1.1 Deciding to consult a doctor\\n• Perceived susceptibility or vulnerability to illness\\n• Perceived severity of symptoms\\n• Perceived costs of consulting\\n• Perceived benefits of consulting\\n1.2 Triggers to consultation\\n• Interpersonal crisis\\n• Interference with social or personal relations\\n• Sanctioning or pressure from family or friends\\n• Interference with work or physical activity\\n• Reaching the limit of tolerance of symptoms\\nA\\nB\\nFig. 1.1 Seating arrangements.  A  In this friendly seating arrangement \\nthe doctor sits next to the patient, at an angle.  B  Barriers to \\ncommunication are set up by an oppositional/confrontational seating \\narrangement. The desk acts as a barrier, and the doctor is distracted by \\nlooking at a computer screen that is not easily viewable by the patient.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '..\\\\data\\\\macleods_clinical_examination_14_ed.pdf'}, page_content='The clinical encounter  •  5\\n1\\nduring the consultation can be clues to difficulties that they \\ncannot express verbally. If the their body language becomes \\n‘closed’ – for example, if they cross their arms and legs, turn \\naway or avoid eye contact – this may indicate discomfort.\\nHandling sensitive information  \\nand third parties\\nConfidentiality is your top priority. Ask your patient’s permission \\nif you need to obtain information from someone else: usually a \\nrelative but sometimes a friend or a carer. If the patient cannot \\ncommunicate, you may have to rely on family and carers to \\nunderstand what has happened to the patient. Third parties may \\napproach you without your patient’s knowledge. Find out who \\nthey are, their relationship to the patient, and whether your patient \\nknows the third party is talking to you. Tell third parties that you \\ncan listen to them but cannot divulge any clinical information \\nwithout the patient’s explicit permission. They may tell you about \\nsensitive matters, such as mental illness, sexual abuse or drug \\nor alcohol addiction. This information needs to be sensitively \\nexplored with your patient to confirm the truth.\\nManaging patient concerns\\nPatients are not simply the embodiment of disease but individuals \\nwho experience illness in their own unique way. Identifying their \\ndisease alone is rarely sufficient to permit full understanding of \\nan individual patient’s problems. In each encounter you should \\ntherefore also seek a clear understanding of the patient’s personal \\nexperience of illness. This involves exploring the patients’ feelings \\nand ideas about their illness, its impact on their lifestyle and \\nfunctioning, and their expectations of its treatment and course.\\nPatients may even be so fearful of a serious diagnosis that \\nthey conceal their concerns; the only sign that a patient fears \\ncancer may be sitting with crossed fingers while the history is \\ntaken, hoping inwardly that cancer is not mentioned. Conversely, \\ndo not assume that the medical diagnosis is always a patient’s \\nmain concern; anxiety about an inability to continue to work \\nor to care for a dependent relative may be equally distressing.\\nThe ideas, concerns and expectations that patients have about \\ntheir illness often derive from their personal belief system, as well \\nas from more widespread social and cultural understandings of \\nillness. These beliefs can influence which symptoms patients \\nchoose to present to doctors and when. In some cultures, people \\nderive much of their prior knowledge about health, illness and \\ndisease from the media and the internet. Indeed, patients have \\noften sought explanations for their symptoms from the internet \\n(or from other trusted sources) prior to consulting a doctor, and \\nmay return to these for a second opinion once they have seen \\na doctor. It is therefore important to establish what a patient \\nalready understands about the problem. This allows you and the \\npatient to move towards a mutual understanding of the illness.\\nShowing empathy\\nBeing empathic is a powerful way to build your relationship with \\npatients. Empathy is the ability to identify with and understand \\npatients’ experiences, thoughts and feelings and to see the world \\nas they do. Being empathic also involves being able to convey \\nthat understanding to the patient by making statements such \\nas ‘I can understand you must be feeling quite worried about \\nwhat this might mean.’ Empathy is not the same as sympathy, \\nOpening the encounter\\nAt the beginning of any encounter it is important to start to \\nestablish a rapport with the patient. Rapport helps to relax and \\nengage the person in a useful dialogue. This involves greeting \\nthe patient and introducing yourself and describing your role \\nclearly. A good reminder is to start any encounter with ‘Hello, \\nmy name is … .’ You should wear a name badge that can \\nbe read easily. A friendly smile helps to put your patient at \\nease. The way you dress is important; your dress style and \\ndemeanour should never make your patients uncomfortable or \\ndistract them. Smart, sensitive and modest dress is appropriate. \\nWear short sleeves or roll long sleeves up, away from your \\nwrists and forearms, particularly before examining patients or \\ncarrying out procedures. Avoid hand jewellery to allow effective \\nhand washing and reduce the risk of cross-infection (see Fig. \\n3.1). Tie back long hair. You should ensure that the patient is \\nphysically comfortable and at ease.\\nHow you address and speak to a patient depends on the \\nperson’s age, background and cultural environment. Some older \\npeople prefer not to be called by their first name and it is best to \\nask patients how they would prefer to be addressed. Go on to \\nestablish the reason for the encounter: in particular, the problems \\nor issues the patient wishes to address or be addressed. Ask \\nan open question to start with to encourage the patient to talk, \\nsuch as ‘How can I help you today?’ or ‘What has brought you \\nalong to see me today?’\\nGathering information\\nThe next task of the doctor in the clinical encounter is to \\nunderstand what is causing the patient to be ill: that is, to reach \\na diagnosis. To do this you need to establish whether or not \\nthe patient is suffering from an identifiable disease or condition, \\nand this requires further evaluation of the patient by history \\ntaking, physical examination and investigation where appropriate. \\nChapters 2 and 3 will help you develop a general approach to \\nhistory taking and physical examination; detailed guidance on \\nhistory taking and physical examination in specific systems and \\ncircumstances is offered in Sections 2 and 3.\\nFear of the unknown, and of potentially serious illness, \\naccompanies many patients as they enter the consulting room. \\nReactions to this vary widely but it can certainly impede clear recall \\nand description. Plain language is essential for all encounters. The \\nuse of medical jargon is rarely appropriate because the risk of \\nthe doctor and the patient having a different understanding of the \\nsame words is simply too great. This also applies to words the \\npatient may use that have multiple possible meanings (such as \\n‘indigestion’ or ‘dizziness’); these terms must always be defined \\nprecisely in the course of the discussion.\\nActive listening is a key strategy in clinical encounters, as it \\nencourages patients to tell their story. Doctors who fill every \\npause with another specific question will miss the patient’s \\nrevealing calm reflection, or the hesitant question that reveals \\nan inner concern. Instead, encourage the patient to talk freely \\nby making encouraging comments or noises, such as ‘Tell me \\na bit more’ or ‘Uhuh’.

When using the telephone, it is \\neven more important to listen actively and to check your mutual \\nunderstanding frequently.\\nSimilarly, asynchronous communication with patients, using \\nemail or web-based applications, has been adopted by some \\ndoctors. This is not yet widely seen as a viable alternative \\nto face-to-face consultation, or as a secure way to transmit \\nconfidential information. Despite the communication challenges \\nthat it can bring, telemedicine (using telecommunication and other \\ninformation technologies) may be the only means of healthcare \\nprovision for patients living in remote and rural areas and its use is \\nlikely to increase, as it has the advantage of having the facility to \\nincorporate the digital collection and transmission of medical data.\\nProfessional responsibilities\\nClinical encounters take place within a very specific context \\nconfigured by the healthcare system within which they occur, \\nthe legal, ethical and professional frameworks by which we are \\nbound, and by society as a whole.\\nFrom your first day as a student, you have professional \\nobligations placed on you by the public, the law and your \\ncolleagues, which continue throughout your working life. Patients \\nmust be able to trust you with their lives and health, and you \\nwill be expected to demonstrate that your practice meets the \\nexpected standards (Box 1.3). Furthermore, patients want more \\nfrom you than merely intellectual and technical proficiency; they \\nwill value highly your ability to demonstrate kindness, empathy \\nand compassion.\\nwhich is about the doctor’s own feelings of compassion for or \\nsorrow about the difficulties that the patient is experiencing.\\nShowing cultural sensitivity\\nPatients from a culture that is not your own may have different \\nsocial rules regarding eye contact, touch and personal space. \\nIn some cultures, it is normal to maintain eye contact for \\nlong periods; in most of the world, however, this is seen as \\nconfrontational or rude. Shaking hands with the opposite sex \\nis strictly forbidden in certain cultures. Death may be dealt with \\ndifferently in terms of what the family expectations of physicians \\nmay be, which family members will expect information to be \\nshared with them and what rites will be followed. Appreciate and \\naccept differences in your patients’ cultures and beliefs. When \\nin doubt, ask them. This lets them know that you are aware of, \\nand sensitive to, these issues.\\nAddressing the problem\\nCommunicating your understanding of the patient’s problem \\nto them is crucial. It is good practice to ensure privacy for this, \\nparticularly if imparting bad news. Ask the patient who else they \\nwould like to be present – this may be a relative or partner – and \\noffer a nurse. Check patients’ current level of understanding and \\ntry to establish what further information they would like. Information \\nshould be provided in small chunks and be tailored to the patient’s \\nneeds. Try to acknowledge and address the patient’s ideas, \\nconcerns and expectations. Check the patient’s understanding \\nand recall of what you have said and encourage questions. After \\nthis, you should agree a management plan together. This might \\ninvolve discussing and exploring the patient’s understanding of \\nthe options for their treatment, including the evidence of benefit \\nand risk for particular treatments and the uncertainties around \\nit, or offering recommendations for treatment.\\nConcluding the encounter\\nClosing the consultation usually involves summarising the \\nimportant points that have been discussed during the consultation. \\nThis aids patient recall and facilitates adherence to treatment. \\nAny remaining questions that the patient may have should be \\naddressed, and finally you should check that you have agreed \\na plan of action together with the patient and confirmed \\narrangements for follow-up.\\nAlternatives to face-to-face \\nencounters\\nThe use of telephone consultation as an alternative to face-to-\\nface consultation has become accepted practice in parts of \\nsome healthcare systems, such as general practice in the UK. \\nHowever, research suggests that, compared to face-to-face \\nconsultations, telephone consultations are shorter, cover fewer \\nproblems and include less data gathering, counselling/advice \\nand rapport building. They are therefore considered to be most \\nsuitable for uncomplicated presentations. Telephone consultation \\nwith patients increases the chance of miscommunication, as \\nthere are no visual cues regarding body language or demeanour. \\nThe telephone should not be used to communicate bad news \\nor sensitive results, as there is no opportunity to gauge reaction \\nCourtesy General Medical Council (UK).\\n1.3 The duties of a registered doctor\\nKnowledge, skills and performance\\n• Make the care of your patient your first concern\\n• Provide a good standard of practice and care:\\n• Keep your professional knowledge and skills up to date\\n• Recognise and work within the limits of your competence\\nSafety and quality\\n•\\n Take prompt action if you think that patient safety, dignity or \\ncomfort is being compromised\\n• Protect and promote the health of patients and the public\\nCommunication, partnership and teamwork\\n•\\n Treat patients as individuals and respect their dignity:\\n• Treat patients politely and considerately\\n• Respect patients’ right to confidentiality\\n• Work in partnership with patients:\\n• Listen to, and respond to, their concerns and preferences\\n• Give patients the information they want or need in a way they \\ncan understand\\n• Respect patients’ right to reach decisions with you about their \\ntreatment and care\\n• Support patients in caring for themselves to improve and \\nmaintain their health\\n• Work with colleagues in the ways that best serve patients’ interests\\nMaintenance of trust\\n•\\n Be honest and open, and act with integrity\\n• Never discriminate unfairly against patients or colleagues\\n• Never abuse your patients’ trust in you or the public’s trust in the \\nprofession'),\n",

In the UK, follow the guidelines issued by the \\nGeneral Medical Council. There are exceptions to the general \\nrules governing patient confidentiality, where failure to disclose \\ninformation would put the patient or someone else at risk of \\ndeath or serious harm, or where disclosure might assist in the \\nprevention, detection or prosecution of a serious crime. If you find \\nyourself in this situation, contact the senior doctor in charge of \\nthe patient’s care immediately and inform them of the situation.\\nAlways obtain consent before undertaking any examination or \\ninvestigation, or when providing treatment or involving patients \\nin teaching or research.\\nSocial media\\nThrough social media, we are able to create and share web-based \\ninformation. As such, social media has the potential to be a \\nvaluable tool in communicating with patients, particularly by \\nfacilitating access to information about health and services, and \\nby providing invaluable peer support for patients. However, they \\nalso have the potential to expose doctors to risks, especially when \\nthere is a blurring of the boundaries between their professional \\nand personal lives. The obligations on doctors do not change \\nbecause they are communicating through social media rather than \\nface to face or through other conventional media. Indeed, using \\nsocial media creates new circumstances in which the established \\nprinciples apply. If patients contact you about their care or other \\nprofessional matters through your private profile, you should \\nindicate that you cannot mix social and professional relationships \\nand, where appropriate, direct them to your professional profile.\\nPersonal responsibilities\\nYou should always be aware that you are in a privileged \\nprofessional position that you must not abuse. Do not pursue \\nan improper relationship with a patient, and do not give medical \\ncare to anyone with whom you have a close personal relationship.\\nFinally, remember that, to be fit to take care of patients, you \\nmust first take care of yourself. If you think you have a medical \\ncondition that you could pass on to patients, or if your judgement \\nor performance could be affected by a condition or its treatment, \\nconsult your general practitioner. Examples might include serious \\ncommunicable disease, significant psychiatric disease, or drug \\nor alcohol addiction.\\nFundamentally, patients want doctors who:\\n•\\t are\\tknowledgeable\\n•\\t respect\\tpeople,\\thealthy\\tor\\till,\\tregardless\\tof\\twho\\tthey\\tare\\n•\\t support\\tpatients\\tand\\ttheir\\tloved\\tones\\twhen\\tand\\twhere\\t\\nneeded\\n•\\t always\\task\\tcourteous\\tquestions,\\tlet\\tpeople\\ttalk\\tand\\tlisten\\t\\nto them carefully\\n•\\t promote\\thealth,\\tas\\twell\\tas\\ttreat\\tdisease\\n•\\t give\\tunbiased\\tadvice\\tand\\tassess\\teach\\tsituation\\tcarefully\\n•\\t use\\tevidence\\tas\\ta\\ttool,\\tnot\\tas\\ta\\tdeterminant\\tof\\tpractice\\n•\\t let\\tpeople\\tparticipate\\tactively\\tin\\tall\\tdecisions\\trelated\\tto\\t\\ntheir health and healthcare\\n•\\t humbly\\taccept\\tdeath\\tas\\tan\\timportant\\tpart\\tof\\tlife,\\tand\\t \\nhelp people make the best possible choices when death  \\nis close\\n•\\t work\\tcooperatively\\twith\\tother\\tmembers\\tof\\tthe\\t \\nhealthcare team\\n•\\t are\\tadvocates\\tfor\\ttheir\\tpatients,\\tas\\twell\\tas\\tmentors\\tfor\\t\\nother health professionals, and are ready to learn from \\nothers, regardless of their age, role or status.\\nOne way to reconcile these expectations with your inexperience \\nand incomplete knowledge or skills is to put yourself in the \\nsituation of the patient and/or relatives.

Chaperones \\nare also advised if the patient is especially anxious or vulnerable, \\nif there have been misunderstandings in the past, or if religious \\nor cultural factors require a different approach to physical \\nexamination. Record the chaperone’s name and presence. If \\npatients decline the offer, respect their wishes and record this \\nin the notes. Tactfully invite relatives to leave the room before \\nphysical examination unless the patient is very apprehensive and \\nrequests that they stay. A parent or guardian should always be \\npresent when you examine children (p. 307).\\nThe room should be warm and well lit; subtle abnormalities \\nof complexion, such as mild jaundice, are easier to detect in \\nnatural light. The height of the examination couch or bed should \\nbe adjustable, with a step to enable patients to get up easily. \\nAn adjustable backrest is essential, particularly for breathless \\npatients who cannot lie flat. It is usual practice to examine a \\nrecumbent patient from the right-hand side of the bed. Ensure \\nthe patient is comfortably positioned before commencing the \\nphysical examination.\\nSeek permission and sensitively, but adequately, expose \\nthe areas to be examined; cover the rest of the patient with \\na blanket or sheet to ensure that they do not become cold. \\nAvoid unnecessary exposure and embarrassment; a patient may \\nappreciate the opportunity to replace their top after examination \\nof the chest before exposing the abdomen. Remain gentle \\ntowards the patient at all times, and be vigilant for aspects \\nof the examination that may cause distress or discomfort. \\nAcknowledge any anxiety or concerns raised by the patient \\nduring the consultation.\\nGeneral principles of physical \\nexamination\\nThe process of taking a history and conducting a physical \\nexamination is artificially separated in classical medical teaching, \\nto encourage learners to develop a structured approach to \\ninformation gathering. However, your physical assessment of \\npatients undoubtedly begins as soon as you see them, and \\nthe astute clinician may notice signs of disease, such as subtle \\nabnormalities of demeanour, gait or appearance, even before \\nthe formal consultation begins. The clinician can be likened to \\na detective, gathering clues, and the physical assessment of a \\npatient can then be seen as the investigation itself!\\nHistorically, great importance has been placed on the value \\nof empirical observation of patients in the formulation of a \\ndifferential diagnosis. Modern technological advances have \\nincreased the reliance on radiological and laboratory testing for \\ndiagnosis, sometimes even at the bedside (such as portable \\nultrasound or near-patient capillary blood ketone testing), and \\nthis has called into question the utility of systematic physical \\nexamination in modern practice. Nevertheless, the importance \\nof performing a methodical and accurate physical examination \\ncannot be overstated. The inconstancy of physical signs and \\nthe need to monitor patient progress by repeated bedside \\nassessment, often conducted by different clinicians, mean that \\na standardised approach to physical examination resulting in \\nreproducible findings is crucial. Additionally, the interpretation of \\nmany diagnostic investigations (such as detection of interstitial \\noedema on a chest X-ray in heart failure) is subject to variation \\nbetween clinicians, as is the detection of physical signs (such \\nas audible crackles on auscultating the lungs). Furthermore, \\nthe utility of many diagnostic investigations relies heavily on the \\npre-test probability (the likelihood of the disease being present \\nprior to the test being performed; p. 362), which depends on \\ninformation gathered during the history and examination. Finally, \\nthere are a number of conditions, or syndromes, that can be \\ndiagnosed only by the detection of a characteristic pattern of \\nphysical signs. Thus by mastering structured skills in physical \\nexamination, clinicians can improve the reliability and precision \\nof their clinical assessment, which, together with the appropriate \\ndiagnostic investigations, lead to accurate diagnosis.\\nPreparing for physical examination\\nIt is important to prepare both yourself and your patient for the \\nphysical examination. As a clinician, you must take reasonable \\nsteps to ensure you can give the patient your undivided attention, \\nin an environment free from interruption, noise or distraction. \\nAlways introduce yourself to the patient, shake hands (which \\nmay provide diagnostic clues; Box 3.1 and see later) and seek \\npermission to conduct the consultation. Make sure you have \\nthe relevant equipment available (Box 3.2) and that you have \\nobserved local hand hygiene policies (Fig. 3.1). As discussed \\non page 4, privacy is essential when assessing a patient. At the \\nvery least, ensure screens or curtains are fully closed around a \\nward bed; where possible, use a separate private room to avoid \\nbeing overheard. Seek permission from the patient to proceed to \\nexamination, and offer a chaperone where appropriate to prevent \\nmisunderstandings and to provide support and encouragement \\nfor the patient.

Lymph nodes may also be palpable in normal \\npeople, especially in the submandibular, axilla and groin regions \\n(Fig. 3.26).\\nAs with any lump, note the size and position of the nodes \\n(normal nodes in adults are <\\n 0.5 cm in diameter) and assess \\nfixation to deeper structures (lymph nodes fixed to deep structures \\nor skin suggest malignancy). Assess consistency: normal nodes \\nfeel soft. In Hodgkin’s lymphoma, they are characteristically \\n‘rubbery’, in tuberculosis they may be ‘matted’, and in metastatic \\ncancer they feel hard. Acute viral or bacterial infection, including \\ninfectious mononucleosis, dental sepsis and tonsillitis, causes \\ntender, variably enlarged lymph nodes.\\nSize\\nMeasure the size of any lump (preferably using callipers).\\nPosition\\nThe source of some lumps may be obvious from position, such \\nas in the breast, thyroid or parotid gland; in other sites, such \\nas the abdomen, this is less clear. Multiple lumps may occur in \\nneurofibromatosis (see Fig. 3.20), skin metastases, lipomatosis \\nand lymphomas.\\nAttachment\\nMalignant masses commonly infiltrate adjacent tissues, causing \\nthem to feel fixed and immobile.\\nLymphatic obstruction may cause skin swelling with fine \\ndimpling where the skin is tethered by hair follicles, giving it an \\n‘orange peel’ appearance (peau d’orange; see Fig. 11.5). This \\nis common in malignant disease when attachment to deeper \\nstructures, such as underlying muscle, may also occur.\\nConsistency\\nThe consistency of a lump can vary from soft to ‘stony’ hard. \\nVery hard swellings are usually malignant, calcified or dense \\nfibrous tissue. Fluctuation indicates the presence of fluid, as in \\nan abscess, cyst or blister (Fig. 3.25), or in soft, encapsulated \\ntumours, such as lipoma. \\nEdge\\nThe margin may be well delineated or ill defined, regular or \\nirregular, and sharp or rounded. The margins of enlarged organs, \\nsuch as the thyroid gland, liver, spleen or kidney, can usually \\nbe defined more clearly than those of inflammatory or malignant \\nmasses. An indefinite margin suggests infiltrating malignancy, in \\ncontrast to the clearly defined edge of a benign tumour.\\nSurface and shape\\nThe surface and shape of a swelling can be characteristic. In \\nthe abdomen, examples include an enlarged spleen or liver, \\na distended bladder or the uterine fundus in pregnancy. The \\nsurface may be smooth or irregular: for example, the surface \\nof the liver is smooth in acute hepatitis but is often nodular in \\nmetastatic disease.\\nPulsations, thrills and bruits\\nArterial swellings (aneurysms) and highly vascular tumours are \\npulsatile, expanding in time with the arterial pulse. Other swellings \\nmay transmit pulsation if they lie over a major blood vessel. If the \\nblood flow through a lump is increased, a systolic murmur (bruit) \\nmay be auscultated; occasionally, with sufficient flow, a thrill may \\nbe palpable.

This rapid fall imparts the ‘collapsing’ \\nsensation, and is exaggerated by raising the patient’s arm above \\nthe level of the heart (see Fig. 4.7B).\\nPulsus bisferiens, an increased pulse with a double systolic \\npeak separated by a distinct mid-systolic dip, is classically \\nproduced by concomitant aortic stenosis and regurgitation. \\nPulsus alternans, beat-to-beat variation in pulse volume with \\na normal rhythm, may occur in advanced heart failure.

Determine whether the \\nmurmur is systolic or diastolic:\\n•\\n Systole begins with S1 (mitral and tricuspid valve \\nclosure). This occurs when left and right ventricular \\npressures exceed the corresponding atrial pressures. \\nFor a short period, all four heart valves are closed \\n(pre-ejection period). Ventricular pressures continue to \\nrise until they exceed those of the aorta and pulmonary \\nartery, causing the aortic and pulmonary valves to \\nopen. Systole ends with the closure of these valves, \\nproducing S\\n2.\\n• Diastole is the interval between S2 and S1. \\nPhysiologically, it is divided into three phases: early \\ndiastole (isovolumic relaxation), the time from the \\nclosure of the aortic and pulmonary valves until the \\nopening of the mitral and tricuspid valves; mid-diastole, \\nthe early period of ventricular filling when atrial \\npressures exceed ventricular pressures; and presystole, \\ncoinciding with atrial systole.\\n•\\n Murmurs of aortic and pulmonary regurgitation start in \\nearly diastole and extend into mid-diastole. The murmurs \\nof mitral or tricuspid stenosis cannot start before \\nmid-diastole. S\\n3 occurs in mid-diastole and S 4 in \\npresystole.\\nDuration\\n• The murmurs of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation start with \\nS1, sometimes muffling or obscuring it, and continue \\nthroughout systole (pansystolic; Fig. 4.23). The murmur \\nproduced by mitral valve prolapse does not begin until the \\nmitral valve leaflet has prolapsed during systole, producing \\na late systolic murmur (Fig. 4.23). The ejection systolic \\nmurmur of aortic or pulmonary stenosis begins after S\\n1 \\nreaches maximal intensity in mid-systole, then fades, \\nstopping before S\\n2 (Fig. 4.24).\\nCharacter and pitch\\n• The quality of a murmur is subjective but terms such as \\nharsh, blowing, musical, rumbling and high- or low-pitched \\ncan be useful. High-pitched murmurs often correspond to \\nmechanism is similar to that of an opening snap. Ejection clicks do \\nnot occur in calcific aortic stenosis because the cusps are rigid.\\nMid-systolic clicks are high-pitched and best heard at the \\napex with the diaphragm. They occur in mitral valve prolapse \\n(Fig. 4.22C) and may be associated with a late systolic murmur.\\nMechanical heart valves can make a sound when they close \\nor open. The closure sound is normally louder, especially with \\nmodern valves. The sounds are high-pitched, ‘metallic’ and often \\npalpable, and may even be heard without a stethoscope. A \\nmechanical mitral valve replacement makes a metallic S\\n1 and \\na sound like a loud opening snap early in diastole (Fig. 4.22D). \\nMechanical aortic valves have a loud, metallic S\\n2 and an opening \\nsound like an ejection click at the start of systole (Fig. 4.22E). \\nThey are normally associated with a flow murmur.\\nPericardial rub (friction rub) is a coarse scratching sound, often \\nwith systolic and diastolic components. It is best heard using \\nthe diaphragm with the patient holding their breath in expiration. \\nIt may be audible over any part of the precordium but is often \\nlocalised, varying in intensity over time and with the position of \\nthe patient. It is most often heard in acute pericarditis or a few \\ndays after an extensive myocardial infarction. A pleuropericardial \\nrub is a similar sound that occurs in time with the cardiac cycle, \\nbut is also influenced by respiration and is pleural in origin. \\nOccasionally, a ‘crunching’ noise can be heard, caused by gas \\nin the pericardium (pneumopericardium).\\nMurmurs\\nHeart murmurs are produced by turbulent flow across an abnormal \\nvalve, septal defect or outflow obstruction. ‘Innocent’ murmurs \\nare caused by increased velocity of flow through a normal valve \\nand occur when stroke volume is increased, as in pregnant \\nwomen, athletes with resting bradycardia or patients with fever.\\nExamination sequence\\nTiming\\n• Identify the first and second heart sounds, S 1 and S2, \\nrespectively.

It is \\nmost commonly caused by an embolus from the heart or by \\nthrombosis in situ of a pre-existing atherosclerotic plaque in one \\nof the mesenteric vessels. It is often hard to diagnose in the early \\nstages, as patients typically present initially with severe abdominal \\npain that is out of proportion to often unimpressive abdominal \\nsigns. Presentation with severe abdominal pain, shock, bloody \\ndiarrhoea and profound metabolic acidosis indicates infarction \\nof the bowel, which carries a high mortality rate. Rarely, renal \\nangle pain occurs from renal infarction or ischaemia, and is \\nassociated with visible or non-visible haematuria.\\nAny patient suspected of having visceral ischaemia should \\nundergo urgent CT angiography.\\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm\\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is an abnormal focal dilatation \\nof\\tthe\\taorta\\tto\\tat\\tleast\\t150%\\tof\\tits\\tnormal\\tdiameter\\t(Fig.\\t4.32).\\t\\nIt is often diagnosed incidentally during a CT scan or alternative \\nimaging for other reasons.\\nPatients may present with abdominal and/or back pain, or \\noccasionally with more subtle signs such as an awareness of \\nabdominal pulsation or observation of ripples in the water when \\nthey are in the bath (wave sign). However, most patients are \\nasymptomatic until the aneurysm ruptures.\\nThe classical features of AAA rupture include abdominal/back \\npain, pulsatile abdominal mass, syncope and shock (hypotension), \\nbut these are not always present and it is important to have \\na low threshold of suspicion and consider early referral and/\\nor CT imaging.\\nDigital ischaemia\\nBlue toes\\nBlue toe syndrome occurs when there is atheroembolism from \\nan AAA or alternative proximal embolic source (such as popliteal \\naneurysm or atherosclerotic plaque). Patchy bluish discoloration \\nappears over the toes and forefoot of one or both feet. There is \\nusually a full set of pedal pulses. Although seemingly innocuous, \\nthis symptom should be taken seriously, as small emboli may \\nherald the risk of a major embolus leading to acute limb ischaemia \\nand even limb loss.\\nVasospastic symptoms\\nRaynaud’s phenomenon is digital ischaemia induced by cold \\nand emotion. It has three phases (Fig. 4.33):\\n•\\t pallor:\\tdue\\tto\\tdigital\\tartery\\tspasm\\tand/or\\tobstruction\\n•\\t cyanosis:\\tdue\\tto\\tdeoxygenation\\tof\\tstatic\\tvenous\\tblood\\t\\n(this phase may be absent)\\n•\\t redness:\\tdue\\tto\\treactive\\thyperaemia.\\nRaynaud’s phenomenon may be primary (Raynaud’s disease) \\nand caused by idiopathic digital artery vasospasm, or secondary to \\nother conditions (Raynaud’s syndrome) such as drugs, connective \\ntissue disease, hyperviscosity syndromes or use of power tools. \\nWhile\\tfor\\tmost\\tpatients\\tthis\\tis\\ta\\tself-limiting\\tcondition,\\ta\\tsmall\\t\\nminority develop tissue loss.\\nPatients over 40 years old presenting with unilateral Raynaud’s \\nphenomenon should be investigated for underlying PAD, especially \\nif they have cardiovascular risk factors, diabetes or a smoking \\nhabit.\\nindicating impending muscle infarction. A limb with these features \\nwill usually become irreversibly damaged unless the circulation \\nis restored within a few hours.\\nIt is important to consider the most likely underlying cause:\\n•\\t Thromboembolism:\\tusually\\tfrom\\tthe\\tleft\\tatrium\\tin\\t\\nassociation with atrial fibrillation or myocardial infarction. \\nThere is usually no history of claudication.\\n•\\t Thrombosis\\tin\\tsitu:\\tthrombotic\\tocclusion\\tof\\tan\\talready\\t\\nnarrowed atherosclerotic arterial segment (Box 4.25). In \\nthis situation the patient is likely to have a past history of \\nclaudication.\\nCompartment syndrome\\nThe perfusion pressure of a muscle is the difference between \\nthe mean arterial pressure and the pressure within the fascial \\ncompartment within which it lies. Compartment syndrome \\noccurs where there is increased pressure within the fascial \\ncompartments of the limb that compromises the perfusion \\nand viability of muscle and nerves. The calf is most commonly \\naffected and the two leading causes are lower limb trauma \\n(such as fractured tibia) and reperfusion injury following treatment \\nof acute lower limb ischaemia. Failure to recognise and treat \\ncompartment syndrome may result in limb amputation. The \\nkey symptom is severe pain that is often unrelieved by opioids \\nand exacerbated by active or passive movement. It is worth \\nremembering that peripheral pulses are usually present, since \\nthe major arteries lie outside the fascial compartments and are \\nnot affected by increased compartment pressure. Compartment \\nmonitors can be used as an adjunct to measure compartment  \\npressure.\\nAbdominal pain\\nMesenteric ischaemia\\nBecause of the rich collateral circulation of the gut, usually two of \\nthe three major visceral arteries (coeliac trunk, superior and inferior \\nmesenteric arteries) must be critically stenosed or occluded before \\nsymptoms and signs of chronic mesenteric arterial insufficiency \\noccur. Severe central abdominal pain typically develops 10–15 \\nminutes after eating. The patient becomes scared of eating and \\nsignificant weight loss is a universal finding.

These include respiratory disease that may recur or \\ncause long-term symptoms, and disease in other systems that \\nmay cause, complicate or present with respiratory symptoms, \\nincluding thromboembolic, cardiovascular, haematological, \\nmalignant and connective tissue diseases.\\nNote prior respiratory treatments (including need for critical care) \\nand the degree of chronic symptoms, such as usual exacerbation \\nfrequency, prescription rate and hospitalisation.\\nDrug and allergy history\\nNote all drugs that the patient is currently using, including \\ninhalers, nebulised bronchodilators and domiciliary oxygen, \\nnon-prescription remedies and recreational drugs. Cross-check \\nthe drug names and doses with a separate source such as the \\ngeneral practitioner’s records.\\nDrugs given for other problems commonly cause respiratory \\nside effects; these are summarised in Box 5.5.\\nAlways ask and record whether the patient has any known \\nallergies, as allergic asthma is far more common in those with \\na history of atopy.\\nFamily history\\nAsk about a family history of asthma, although this is common \\nin the population and therefore not highly predictive. Respiratory \\ndiseases with a known genetic cause are relatively rare. Most \\npatients with cystic fibrosis have unaffected carrier parents but \\nmany have affected siblings.\\nSocial history\\nAlways start by identifying the patient’s normal level of daily \\nactivity and the impact of their recent symptoms on this. Can \\nthey still manage their work, their self-care and any caring they  \\ndeliver?\\npersist long after the rash has resolved, often with scarring in \\nthe dermatomal distribution.\\nBurning retrosternal pain may indicate oesophagitis but also \\noccurs with myocardial ischaemia. Alteration of discomfort after \\neating or antacids helps to distinguish oesophageal pain; cardiac \\npain is described on page 40.\\nCentral, constant, progressive, non-pleuritic chest pain may \\nrepresent\\tmediastinal\\tdisease,\\tparticularly\\tmalignancy.\\tSimilarly,\\t\\nchest wall pain (without trauma) that is constant, progressive \\nand non-pleuritic suggests chest wall invasion by malignancy. \\nPain-induced sleep disturbance is a feature of such malignant \\npains.\\nFevers/rigors/night sweats\\nThese symptoms are not specific to respiratory medicine but are \\ncommonly reported by patients with respiratory diseases. Infection \\n(acute or chronic) is the usual cause but other aetiologies such as \\nlung cancer, lymphoma or vasculitis should also be considered.\\nPatients use a range of terms to describe fever (such as shivers, \\nchills, being ‘hot and bothered’, shakes), so ask for a detailed \\naccount of their symptoms using common terms.\\nRigors are generalised, uncontrollable episodes of vigorous \\nbody shaking lasting a few minutes. Despite high fever, the \\npatient may complain of feeling cold and seek extra clothing. \\nRigors usually indicate bacterial sepsis; lobar pneumonia and \\nacute pyelonephritis are the most common causes. They can \\nbe misinterpreted as seizures but the retention of consciousness \\nand associated pyrexia suggest rigors.\\nNight sweats are more closely associated with chronic \\ninfection (such as tuberculosis) and malignancy or lymphoma \\nrather than acute infection. Occasional episodes of a sweaty \\nhead or pillow are inconclusive, but if patients report having to \\nchange their nightclothes or sheets frequently due to profuse \\nnocturnal sweating over several weeks, this is more likely to \\nindicate underlying disease.\\nWeight loss\\nWeight loss is a common feature of several important respiratory \\ndiseases:\\n•\\t lung\\tcancers\\n•\\t chronic\\tinfective\\tdiseases\\t(such\\tas\\ttuberculosis\\tand\\t\\nbronchiectasis)\\n•\\t diseases\\tcausing\\tchronic\\tbreathlessness\\t(such\\tas\\tCOPD\\t\\nand interstitial lung diseases).\\nThe pathophysiology is complex; however, breathlessness \\nis associated with diminished appetite, and the systemic \\ninflammatory response is also thought to contribute to weight loss.\\nSmall\\tamounts\\tof\\tweight\\tloss\\talso\\toccur\\tin\\tacute\\tinfection\\twith\\t\\nconsequent loss of appetite, particularly during hospitalisation. \\nAsk the patient to estimate the extent and duration of weight loss, \\nand enquire about appetite and dietary intake.

This most commonly complicates pneumothorax with \\nchest drainage or rib fracture, and feels like a palpable crackling \\nunder the skin of the upper thorax and neck.\\nPercussion\\nCorrectly performed, percussion can distinguish areas of the \\nchest wall over air-filled lung from those overlying consolidated \\nlung or fluid. It generates a hollow, ringing sound accompanied by \\na palpable resonance over air-filled lung, but a dull thud lacking \\nresonance over consolidation or fluid. The absolute quality and \\nvolume of the percussed sound vary widely between individuals \\nwith differing chest wall thickness, muscularity and subcutaneous \\nfat, and is of little value. The value of percussion lies in detecting \\nasymmetry of resonance between mirror image positions on the \\nright and left sides.\\nExamination sequence \\n• To percuss the chest, apply the middle finger of your \\nnon-dominant hand firmly to an intercostal space, parallel \\nto the ribs, and drum the middle phalanx with the flexed \\ntip of your dominant index or middle finger (Fig. 5.16A).\\n•\\n Percuss in sequence, comparing areas on the right with \\ncorresponding areas on the left before moving to the next \\nlevel (Fig. 5.16B).\\n•\\n Posteriorly, the scapular and spinal muscles obstruct \\npercussion, so position the patient sitting forwards with \\ntheir arms folded in front to move the scapulae laterally. \\nPercuss a few centimetres lateral to the spinal muscles, \\ntaking care to compare positions the same distance from \\nthe midline on right and left (Fig. 5.16C).\\nIn healthy people, anterior chest percussion is symmetrical \\nexcept for the area immediately lateral to the lower left sternal \\nedge, where the right ventricle causes dullness; this ‘cardiac \\ndullness’ is lost in hyperinflated patients in whom the lingula \\noverlies the heart (see Fig. 5.5). Clear resonance is the usual \\nfinding over a pneumothorax, although the difference between \\nnormal lung and pneumothorax may be quite subtle because \\nasthma or COPD), forced, rapid inspiration often causes visible \\nindrawing of the skin in the intercostal spaces during inspiration, \\nseen more easily with tangential light (see Fig. 5.6A).\\nPalpation\\nExamination sequence\\n• Locate the apex beat, the most inferior and lateral place \\nwhere the finger is lifted by the twisting systolic movement \\nof the cardiac apex.

Pull your hands medially towards each \\nother to tighten any loose skin, and use your thumbs (off \\nthe skin) as pointers to judge how much each hand moves \\noutwards when the patient is instructed to take a full \\nbreath in (Fig. 5.14).

Resonance on percussion together \\nwith unilateral absent breath sounds indicates pneumothorax.\\nAuscultation\\nTo understand chest auscultation it is necessary to understand \\nthe origin of breath sounds. The tracheobronchial tree branches \\n23 times between the trachea and the alveoli. This results in an \\nexponential rise in the number of airways and their combined \\ncross-sectional area moving towards the alveoli. During a maximal \\nbreath in and out, the same vital capacity (about 5  L of air in \\nhealthy adults) passes through each generation of airway. In \\nthe larynx and trachea, this volume must all pass through a \\ncross-sectional area of only a few square centimetres and therefore \\nflow rate is fast, causing turbulence with vibration of the airway \\nwall and generating sound. In the distal airway, the very large \\ntotal cross-sectional area of the multitude of bronchioles means \\nthat 5 L can easily pass at slow flow rates, so flow is normally \\nvirtually silent. The harsh ‘bronchial’ sound generated by the \\nmajor airways can be appreciated by listening with the diaphragm \\nof the stethoscope applied to the larynx (try this on yourself).\\nMost of the sound heard when auscultating the chest wall \\noriginates in the large central airways but is muffled and deadened \\nby passage through overlying air-filled alveolar tissue; this, together \\nwith a small contribution from medium-sized airways, results in \\n‘normal’ breath sounds at the chest wall, sometimes termed \\n‘vesicular’. When healthy, air-filled lung becomes consolidated \\nby pneumonia or thickened and stiffened by fibrosis, sound \\nconduction is improved, and the centrally generated ‘bronchial’ \\nbreath sounds appear clearly and loudly on the overlying chest \\nwall. In the same way, with soft speech (‘say one, one, one’), \\nthe laryngeal sounds are muffled by healthy lung but heard \\nclearly and loudly at the chest wall overlying consolidation and \\nfibrosis, due to improved conduction of major airway sounds \\nthrough diseased lung.\\nWhen there is lobar collapse caused by a proximal bronchial \\nobstruction, the signs are different from those in simple \\nconsolidation. The usual findings are diminished expansion, \\nsometimes with chest asymmetry due to loss of volume, dullness \\nto percussion over the collapsed lobe, and reduced breath sounds \\nand vocal resonance.\\nWhen the lung tissue is physically separated from the chest \\nwall by intervening air (pneumothorax) or fluid (pleural effusion), \\nsound conduction is greatly impaired and the breath sounds \\nBCA\\nFig. 5.16 Percussion of the chest.

This approach is summarised in Box 5.6.\\nInvestigations\\nSelecting\\tthe\\trelevant\\tinvestigation\\tdepends\\ton\\tthe\\tclinical\\tproblem\\t\\nrevealed on history and examination. Investigations are costly \\nand many carry risks, so choose tests capable of distinguishing \\nthe likely diagnoses and prioritise the most decisive ones. In \\nrespiratory disease, imaging of the lungs is fundamental, but \\nrespiratory function testing is equally important to distinguish \\nobstructive disease of the airways from the restrictive pattern \\nseen in many parenchymal diseases, and to quantify the degree \\nof abnormality. A summary of the appropriate initial investigations \\naccording to the type of respiratory presentation is included in \\nBox 5.7.\\nAdded sounds\\nThere are three common added sounds: wheezes, crackles \\nand rubs. Wheeze is a musical whistling sound accompanying \\nairflow and usually originates in narrowed small airways. It is \\nmost commonly expiratory, due to dynamic airway narrowing \\non expiration, but can also occur on inspiration. Usually, multiple \\nwheezing sounds are heard together (polyphonic wheeze); this \\nsign is common in asthma, bronchitis and exacerbation of COPD. \\nA solitary wheeze that is present consistently with each breath and \\ndoes not clear with coughing suggests a possible fixed bronchial \\nobstruction and can be an important sign of underlying cancer.\\nCrackles accompanying deep breathing are thought to \\nrepresent the sudden opening of small airways but sometimes \\nmay indicate secretions in the airways or underlying lung fibrosis. \\nIn healthy people, gravitational compression of the dependent \\nlung bases often causes a few crackles on the first few deep \\nbreaths; these are of no pathological significance. Crackles that \\npersist after several breaths and do not clear with a deliberate \\ncough are pathological. They are graded as ‘fine’, meaning soft, \\nmultiple crackles, to ‘coarse’, indicating loud, scanty crackles \\nthat\\ttend\\tto\\tchange\\twith\\teach\\tbreath.\\tShowers\\tof\\tfine\\tcrackles\\t\\nduring inspiration, resembling the sound made by peeling a \\nVelcro\\tfastener,\\tare\\tcharacteristic\\tof\\tinterstitial\\tpulmonary\\tfibrosis,\\t \\nand are most commonly heard at the lung bases posteriorly \\nand laterally. Fine crackles also occur in pulmonary oedema and \\nsome viral pneumonias. Coarse crackles are generally heard in \\npatients with significant purulent airway secretions such as those \\nwith bronchopneumonia or bronchiectasis. Inspiratory crackles \\nare also often heard over the areas of incompletely inflated lung \\nimmediately above a pleural effusion.\\nPleural rub is a rasping, grating sound occurring with each \\nbreath and sounding superficial, just under the stethoscope, like \\ntwo sheets of sandpaper rubbing together. It indicates pleural \\ninflammation, usually due to infection, and is often accompanied \\nby pleuritic chest pain.\\nVocal resonance\\nBreath sounds normally reveal the presence of consolidation or \\nfibrosis (bronchial breath sounds) or pleural air or fluid (absent \\n5.6 Categories of respiratory disease and associated features on history and examination\\nCategory of problem Suggestive features on history Suggestive features on examination\\nInfection: Fever\\n Acute bronchitis Wheeze, cough, sputum Wheeze\\n Exacerbation of chronic obstructive \\npulmonary disease\\nAcute-on-chronic dyspnoea Hyperinflation\\n Pneumonia Pleuritic pain, rusty sputum, rigors If lobar, dull to percussion and bronchial breathing\\nMalignancy Insidious onset, weight loss, persisting pain \\nor cough\\nCervical lymphadenopathy, clubbing, signs of lobar/lung \\ncollapse ± effusion\\nPulmonary fibrosis Progressive dyspnoea Tachypnoea, inspiratory fine crackles at bases, cyanosis\\nPleural effusion Progressive dyspnoea Unilateral basal dullness and reduced breath sounds\\nPulmonary embolism:\\n Large Sudden, severe dyspnoea Normal breath sounds\\n Medium Episodes of pleural pain, haemoptysis Pleural rub, swollen leg if deep vein thrombosis, crackles \\nif infarct\\n Multiple small Progressive dyspnoea Raised jugular venous pressure, right ventricular heave, \\nloud pulmonary second sound\\nAsthma Atopy, hay fever, pet ownership, variable \\nwheeze, disturbance of sleep\\nPolyphonic expiratory wheeze, eczema'),\n",

Obstruction distal to the pylorus \\nproduces bile-stained vomit. Severe vomiting without significant \\npain suggests gastric outlet or proximal small bowel obstruction. \\nFaeculent vomiting of small bowel contents (not faeces) is a late \\nfeature of distal small bowel or colonic obstruction. In peritonitis, \\nthe vomitus is usually small in volume but persistent. The more \\ndistal the level of intestinal obstruction, the more marked the \\naccompanying abdominal distension and colic.\\nVomiting is common in gastroenteritis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis \\nand hepatitis.

In conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia, the urine is dark brown \\ndue to the presence of bilirubin diglucuronide. In the colon, \\nconjugated bilirubin is metabolised by bacteria to stercobilinogen \\nand stercobilin, which contribute to the brown colour of stool. \\nStercobilinogen is absorbed from the bowel and excreted in the \\nurine as urobilinogen, a colourless, water-soluble compound.\\nMelaena\\nMelaena is the passage of tarry, shiny black stools with a \\ncharacteristic odour and results from upper gastrointestinal \\nbleeding.

Excessive alcohol ingestion \\nmay cause haematemesis from erosive gastritis, Mallory–Weiss \\ntear or bleeding oesophagogastric varices in cirrhotic patients. \\nOesophageal or gastric cancer and gastric angioectasias (Dieulafoy \\nlesion) are rare causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.\\nThe Rockall and Blatchford scores are used to assess the \\nrisk in gastrointestinal bleeding (Box 6.5).

It has an internal ring at \\nthe mid-inguinal point (midway between the pubic symphysis \\nand the anterior superior iliac spine) and an external ring at the \\npubic tubercle. The femoral canal lies below the inguinal ligament \\nand lateral to the pubic tubercle.\\nHernias are common and typically occur at openings of the \\nabdominal wall, such as the inguinal, femoral and obturator \\ncanals, the umbilicus and the oesophageal hiatus.

Some symptoms, including loss of \\nconsciousness or amnesia, require an additional witness history; \\nmake every effort to contact such witnesses.\\nRemember the two key questions: where (in the nervous \\nsystem) is the lesion and what is the lesion?\\nNeurological symptoms may be difficult for patients to describe, \\nso clarify exactly what they tell you. Words such as ‘blackout’, \\n‘dizziness’, ‘weakness’ and ‘numbness’ may have different \\nmeanings for different patients, so ensure you understand what \\nthe person is describing.\\nAsk patients what they think or fear might be wrong with \\nthem, as neurological symptoms cause much anxiety. Patients \\ncommonly research their symptoms on the internet; searches \\non common benign neurological symptoms, like numbness or \\nweakness, usually list the most alarming (and unlikely) diagnoses \\nsuch multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease or brain tumours \\nfirst, and almost never mention more common conditions such \\nas carpal tunnel syndrome or functional disorders.\\nTime relationships\\nThe onset, duration and pattern of symptoms over time often \\nprovide diagnostic clues: for example, in assessing headache \\n(Box 7.1) or vertigo (see Box 9.3).\\nAsk:\\n•\\t When\\tdid\\tthe\\tsymptoms\\tstart\\t(or\\twhen\\twas\\tthe\\tpatient\\t\\nlast well)?\\n•\\t Are\\tthey\\tpersistent\\tor\\tintermittent?\\n•\\t If\\tpersistent,\\tare\\tthey\\tgetting\\tbetter,\\tgetting\\tworse\\tor\\t\\nstaying the same?\\nAnatomy and physiology\\nThe nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord (central \\nnervous system, CNS) and the peripheral nerves (peripheral \\nnervous system, PNS). The PNS includes the autonomic nervous \\nsystem, responsible for control of involuntary functions.\\nThe neurone is the functional unit of the nervous system. Each \\nneurone has a cell body and axon terminating at a synapse, \\nsupported by astrocytes and microglial cells. Astrocytes provide \\nthe structural framework for the neurones, control their biochemical \\nenvironment and form the blood–brain barrier. Microglial cells \\nare blood-derived mononuclear macrophages with immune and \\nscavenging\\tfunctions.\\tIn\\tthe\\tCNS,\\toligodendrocytes\\tproduce\\t\\nand\\tmaintain\\ta\\tmyelin\\tsheath\\taround\\tthe\\taxons.\\tIn\\tthe\\tPNS,\\t\\nmyelin is produced by Schwann cells.\\nThe brain consists of two cerebral hemispheres, each with \\nfour lobes (frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital), the brainstem \\nand the cerebellum. The brainstem comprises the midbrain, pons \\nand medulla. The cerebellum lies in the posterior fossa, with two \\nhemispheres and a central vermis attached to the brainstem by \\nthree pairs of cerebellar peduncles. Between the brain and the \\nskull are three membranous layers called the meninges: dura mater \\nnext to the bone, arachnoid and pia mater next to the nervous \\ntissue. The subarachnoid space between the arachnoid and pia \\nis filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) produced by the choroid \\nplexuses. The total volume of CSF is between 140 and 270 mL \\nand there is a turnover of the entire volume 3–4 times a day; \\nthus CSF is produced at a rate of approximately 700 mL per day.\\nThe spinal cord contains afferent and efferent fibres arranged \\nin discrete bundles (pathways running to and from the brain), \\nwhich are responsible for the transmission of motor and sensory \\ninformation. Peripheral nerves have myelinated and unmyelinated \\naxons. The sensory cell bodies of peripheral nerves are situated in \\nthe dorsal root ganglia. The motor cell bodies are in the anterior \\nhorns of the spinal cord (Fig. 7.1).\\n7.1 Clinical characteristics of headache syndromes\\nOnset Duration/periodicity Pain location Associated features\\nPrimary syndromes\\nMigraine Evolves over \\n30–120 mins\\nUsually last < 24 h, recurrent \\nwith weeks/months \\nsymptom-free\\nClassically unilateral but \\nmay be anywhere \\nincluding face/neck\\nAura (usually visual), nausea/vomiting, \\nphotophobia and phonophobia\\nCluster headache Rapid onset, often \\nwaking patient from \\nsleep\\n30–120 mins, 1–4 attacks \\nwithin 24 h, clusters usually \\nlast weeks to months, with \\nmonths to years of remission\\nOrbital/retro-orbital; \\nalways same side during \\ncluster, may switch \\nsides between clusters\\nAutonomic features, including \\nconjunctival injection, tearing, nasal \\nstuffiness, ptosis, miosis, agitation\\nStabbing headache Abrupt, rarely from sleep Very brief, seconds or less Anywhere over head Common in migraineurs\\nSecondary syndromes\\nMeningitis Usually evolves over a \\nday or two, can be \\nabrupt\\nDepends on cause and \\ntreatment, usually days to \\nweeks\\nGlobal, including neck \\nstiffness\\nFever, meningism, rash, false localising \\nsigns, signs of raised intracranial \\npressure\\nSubarachnoid \\nhaemorrhage\\nAbrupt, immediately \\nmaximal, rare from sleep\\nMay be fatal at onset, \\nusually days to weeks\\nAnywhere, poor \\nlocalising value\\n20% isolated headache only; nausea/\\nvomiting, reduced consciousness, false \\nlocalising signs, III nerve palsies\\nTemporal arteritis Gradual onset of temple \\npain and scalp \\ntenderness\\nContinuous Temple and scalp Usually in those >\\n 55 years; unwell, jaw \\npain on chewing, visual symptoms, tender \\ntemporal arteries, elevated erythrocyte \\nsedimentation rate and C-reactive protein'),\n",

A tonic–clonic seizure (convulsion) is the \\nmost common form of generalised seizure, and typically follows a \\nstereotyped pattern with early loss of consciousness associated \\nwith body stiffening (tonic phase) succeeded by rhythmical jerking \\ncrescendoing and subsiding over 30–120 seconds (clonic phase); \\nthis is followed by a period of unresponsiveness (often with \\nheavy breathing, the patient appearing to be deeply asleep) and \\nfinally confusion as the patient reorientates (postictal phase). \\nThe history from the patient and witnesses can help distinguish \\nsyncope from epilepsy (Box 7.2). Focal seizures may or may not \\ninvolve loss of awareness (complete loss of consciousness is less \\ntypical) and are characterised by whichever part of the brain is \\ninvolved: for example, a focal motor seizure arising from the motor \\ncortex, or temporal lobe seizures characterised by autonomic \\nand/or psychic symptoms, often associated with automatisms \\nsuch as lip smacking or swallowing. Functional dissociative \\nattacks (also known as non-epileptic or psychogenic attacks, or \\npseudoseizures) are common, and may be difficult to distinguish \\nfrom epileptic seizures. These attacks are often more frequent \\nthan epilepsy, sometimes occurring multiple times in a day, and \\nmay last considerably longer, with symptoms waxing and waning. \\nOther features may include asynchronous movements, pelvic \\nthrusts, side-to-side rather than flexion/extension movements \\nand absence of postictal confusion. The widespread availability \\nof videophones allows witnesses to capture such events and \\nmay prove invaluable.\\n•\\t If\\tintermittent,\\thow\\tlong\\tdo\\tthey\\tlast,\\tand\\thow\\tlong\\tdoes\\t\\nthe patient remain symptom-free in between episodes?\\n•\\t Was\\tthe\\tonset\\tsudden\\tor\\tgradual/evolving?\\nPrecipitating, exacerbating or  \\nrelieving factors\\n•\\t What\\twas\\tthe\\tpatient\\tdoing\\twhen\\tthe\\tsymptoms\\t\\noccurred?\\n•\\t Does\\tanything\\tmake\\tthe\\tsymptoms\\tbetter\\tor\\tworse,\\t \\nsuch as time of day, menstrual cycle, posture or \\nmedication?\\nAssociated symptoms\\nAssociated symptoms can aid diagnosis. For example, headache \\nmay be associated with nausea, vomiting, photophobia (aversion \\nto light) and/or phonophobia (aversion to sound) in migraine; \\nheadache with neck stiffness, fever and rash may be associated \\nwith meningitis (Box 7.1).\\nCommon presenting symptoms\\nHeadache\\nHeadache is the most common neurological symptom and \\nmay be either primary or secondary to other pathology. Primary \\n(idiopathic) causes include:\\n•\\t migraine\\n•\\t tension-type\\theadache\\n•\\t trigeminal\\tautonomic\\tcephalalgias\\t(including\\tcluster\\t\\nheadache)\\n•\\t primary\\tstabbing,\\tcough,\\texertional\\tor\\tsex\\theadache\\n•\\t primary\\tthunderclap\\theadache\\n•\\t new\\tdaily\\tpersistent\\theadache.\\nSecondary (or symptomatic) headaches are less common, \\nbut include potentially life-threatening or disabling causes such \\nas subarachnoid haemorrhage or temporal arteritis. One of the \\nkey history aspects is rapidity of onset; isolated headache with \\na truly abrupt onset may represent a potentially serious cause \\nsuch as subarachnoid haemorrhage or cerebral vein thrombosis, \\nwhereas recurrent headache is much more likely to be migraine, \\nparticularly if associated with other migrainous features like aura, \\nnausea and/or vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia (Box \\n7.1). Asking patents what they do when they have a headache \\ncan be instructive. For example, abandoning normal tasks and \\nseeking a bed in a dark, quiet room suggest migraine, whereas \\npacing around the room in an agitated state, or even head \\nbanging, suggests cluster headache.\\nTransient loss of consciousness\\nSyncope is loss of consciousness due to inadequate cerebral \\nperfusion and is the most common cause of transient loss of \\nconsciousness (TLOC). Vasovagal (or reflex) syncope (fainting) \\nis the most common type and precipitated by stimulation of the \\nparasympathetic nervous system, as with pain or intercurrent \\nillness. Exercise-related syncope, or syncope with no warning or \\ntrigger, suggests a possible cardiac cause. TLOC on standing \\nis suggestive of orthostatic (postural) hypotension and may be \\ncaused by drugs (antihypertensives or levodopa) or associated \\nwith autonomic neuropathies, which may complicate conditions \\nsuch as diabetes.\\n7.2 Features that help discriminate vasovagal syncope  \\nfrom epileptic seizure\\nFeature Vasovagal syncope Seizure\\nTriggers Typically pain, illness, \\nemotion\\nOften none (sleep \\ndeprivation, alcohol, \\ndrugs)\\nProdrome Feeling faint/\\nlightheaded, nausea, \\ntinnitus, vision \\ndimming\\nFocal onset (not always \\npresent)\\nDuration of \\nunconsciousness\\n<\\n 60 s 1–2 mins\\nConvulsion May occur but usually \\nbrief myoclonic jerks\\nUsual, tonic–clonic \\n1–2 mins\\nColour Pale/grey Flushed/cyanosed, may \\nbe pale\\nInjuries Uncommon, \\nsometimes biting of \\ntip of tongue\\nLateral tongue biting, \\nheadache, generalised \\nmyalgia, back pain \\n(sometimes vertebral \\ncompression fractures), \\nshoulder fracture/\\ndislocation (rare)\\nRecovery Rapid, no confusion\\nGradual, over 30 mins; \\npatient is often confused, \\nsometimes agitated/\\naggressive, amnesic'),\n",

These \\nsymptoms are often called ‘functional’ but other (less useful \\nand more pejorative) terms include psychogenic, hysterical, \\nsomatisation or conversion disorders. Presentations include \\nblindness, tremor, weakness and collapsing attacks, and patients \\nwill often describe numerous other symptoms, with fatigue, \\nlethargy, pain, anxiety and other mood disorders commonly \\nassociated.\\tDiagnosing\\tfunctional\\tsymptoms\\trequires\\texperience\\t\\nand patience (p. 363). Clues include symptoms not compatible \\nwith disease (such as retained awareness of convulsing during \\nnon-epileptic attacks, or being able to walk normally backwards \\nbut not forwards), considerable variability in symptoms (such \\nas intermittent recovery of a hemiparesis), multiple symptoms \\n(often with numerous previous assessments by other specialties, \\nparticularly gynaecology, gastroenterology, ear, nose and throat \\nand cardiorespiratory) and multiple unremarkable investigations, \\nleading to numerous different diagnoses. The size of a patient’s \\ncase notes can sometimes be a clue in itself! Beware of labelling \\nsymptoms as functional simply because they appear odd or \\ninexplicable. Like disease, most functional neurological disorders \\nfollow recognisable patterns, so be cautious when the pattern \\nis atypical.\\nPast medical history\\nSymptoms that the patient has forgotten about or overlooked may \\nbe important; for example, a history of previous visual loss (optic \\nneuritis) in someone presenting with numbness suggests multiple \\nsclerosis.

Meningism suggests infection \\n(meningitis) or blood within the subarachnoid space (subarachnoid \\nhaemorrhage) but can occur with non-neurological infections, such \\nas urinary tract infection or pneumonia.

Note any \\nscars or other signs of trauma.\\n•\\n Look for wasting of the interossei (dorsal guttering).\\n• Test for weakness of finger abduction with the patient’s \\nfingers on a flat surface, and ask them to spread the \\nfingers against resistance from your fingers.\\n•\\n Test adduction by asking them to grip a card placed \\nbetween their fingers and pulling it out using your own \\nfingers.\\n•\\n Assess for sensory loss on the ulnar side of the hand, \\nsplitting the ring finger (see Fig. 7.27C).\\nCommon peroneal nerve\\nThe nerve may be damaged by fractures as it winds around \\nthe fibular head, or it may be compressed, particularly in thin, \\nimmobile patients or as a result of repetitive kneeling, squatting \\nor\\tsitting\\twith\\tthe\\tlegs\\tcrossed\\tat\\tthe\\tknees.\\tIt\\ttypically\\tcauses\\t\\na foot drop.\\nExamination sequence\\n• Test for weakness of ankle dorsiflexion and eversion;  \\ntest for extension of the big toe (extensor hallucis  \\nlongus).\\tInversion\\tand\\tthe\\tankle\\treflex\\twill\\tbe\\t \\npreserved.\\n• Test for sensory loss over the dorsum of the foot (see  \\nFig.\\t7.27D).\\nLateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh\\nThis purely sensory nerve may be compressed as it passes \\nunder the inguinal ligament, producing paraesthesiae in the lateral \\nthigh (meralgia paraesthetica, which means burning numbness) \\n(see Fig. 7.27E).\\nExamination sequence\\n• Ask the patient to map out the area of disturbance.\\n• Test for disturbed sensation over the lateral aspect of the \\nthigh. Palpate the abdomen and groin for masses or \\ninguinal lymph nodes.\\nInterpretation of the findings\\nHaving completed the history and examination, first decide \\nwhether the symptoms are due to neurological disease, a \\nfunctional neurological disorder or non-neurological causes.

She has \\nvomited the analgesia she took. She often has headaches at the time of her period but this is the worst headache she has ever experienced. She \\nrecalls having one or two migraines as a child, and her mother had migraine. She is otherwise well and takes no medication other than the oral \\ncontraceptive. The examination is normal, although she looks tired and distressed.\\nSuggest a differential diagnosis\\nThe most likely diagnosis is migraine; the headache evolved and worsened over a few hours, with no ‘red flags’, on a background of a predisposition \\nto migraine. The differential includes more sinister causes such as meningitis, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or intracranial haemorrhage, but there \\nare no features to support these. The headache is likely to resolve in the next day or two.\\nSuggest initial investigations\\nShe does not need any tests, as there are no features to suggest she needs brain imaging or lumbar puncture to exclude a subarachnoid haemorrhage \\nor meningitis.\\nthe investigation of epilepsy, encephalopathies or dementia. \\nModifications to standard EEG improve sensitivity and include \\nsleep-deprived studies, prolonged videotelemetry and invasive \\nEEG monitoring.\\nElectromyography (EMG) involves needle electrodes inserted \\ninto muscle.

They are common and usually \\nheal spontaneously within a few days. Oral ulcers can be caused \\nby trauma, vitamin or mineral deficiency, cancer, lichen planus \\nor inflammatory bowel disease.\\nAnatomy and physiology\\nMouth\\nThe mouth extends from the lips anteriorly to the anterior tonsillar \\npillar posteriorly and is divided into the vestibule, between the \\nbuccal (cheek) mucosa and the teeth, and the oral cavity internal \\nto the teeth. The oral cavity contains the anterior two-thirds of \\nthe tongue, the floor of the mouth, the hard palate and the inner \\nsurfaces of the gums and teeth (Fig. 9.18). The tongue anteriorly \\nhas filiform papillae containing taste buds, giving the tongue its \\nvelvet texture. The circumvallate papillae are groups of taste \\nbuds marking the boundary between the anterior two-thirds \\nand posterior third of the tongue.\\nSaliva is secreted into the mouth from the parotid, submandibular \\nand sublingual salivary glands (Fig. 9.19). The parotid gland is \\nsituated anterior to the ear and has a superficial and deep lobe \\nrelative to the facial nerve that runs through it. The parotid duct \\nopens into the buccal mucosa opposite the second upper molar. \\nThe submandibular gland lies anterior and medial to the angle \\nof the mandible and its duct opens into the floor of the mouth \\nnext to the frenulum of the tongue (see Fig. 9.18).\\nThroat\\nThe pharynx is a shared upper aerodigestive channel that runs \\nfrom the anterior tonsillar pillar to the laryngeal inlet. The larynx \\n(‘voice box’) is responsible for phonation and also has a protective \\nfunction to prevent aspiration. It consists of two external cartilages, \\nthe thyroid cartilage (Adam’s apple) and the cricoid cartilage \\n(prominence at the top of the trachea; see Fig. 10.1A). The \\nmembrane between the two is called the cricothyroid membrane; \\na cricothyroidotomy may be performed by an experienced \\nclinician at this site as an emergency procedure to obtain an \\nairway. The sensory supply to the larynx is via the superior and \\nrecurrent laryngeal branches of cranial nerve X (vagus).

Diseases may result \\nfrom excessive or inadequate hormone production, or target \\norgan hypersensitivity or resistance to the hormone. The main \\nendocrine glands are the pituitary, thyroid, adrenals, gonads \\n(testes and ovaries), parathyroids and the endocrine pancreas. \\nWith the notable exception of the pancreatic islet cells (which \\nrelease insulin) and the parathyroids, most endocrine glands \\nare themselves controlled by hormones released from the  \\npituitary.\\nSince hormones circulate throughout the body, symptoms and \\nsigns of endocrine disease are frequently non-specific, affecting \\nmany body systems (Box 10.1). Often, endocrine disease is \\npicked up incidentally during biochemical testing or radiological \\nimaging. Careful history taking and examination are required to \\nrecognise characteristic patterns of disease. Thyroid disease and \\ndiabetes mellitus are common and frequently familial; establishing \\na detailed family history is therefore important. Some less common \\nendocrine disorders (such as multiple endocrine neoplasia) show \\nan autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance.\\nTHE THYROID\\nAnatomy and physiology\\nThe thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland that lies inferior to the \\ncricoid cartilage, approximately 4 cm below the superior notch \\nof the thyroid cartilage (Fig. 10.1A). The normal thyroid has a \\nvolume of <\\n 20 mL and is palpable in about 50% of women and \\n25% of men. It is comprised of a central isthmus approximately \\n1.5 cm wide, covering the second to fourth tracheal rings, and \\ntwo lateral lobes that are usually no larger than the distal phalanx \\nof the patient’s thumb. The gland may extend into the superior \\nmediastinum and can be partly or entirely retrosternal. Rarely, it \\ncan be located higher in the neck along the line of the thyroglossal \\nduct, an embryological remnant of the descent of the thyroid \\nfrom the base of the tongue to its final position. Thyroglossal \\ncysts can also arise from the thyroglossal duct; they often occur \\nat the level of the hyoid bone (Fig. 10.1A) and characteristically \\nmove upwards on tongue protrusion. The thyroid is attached to \\nthe pretracheal fascia and thus moves superiorly on swallowing \\nor neck extension.\\nThyrotoxicosis is a clinical state of increased metabolism caused \\nby elevated circulating levels of thyroid hormones. Graves’ disease \\nis the most common cause (Fig. 10.2 and Box 10.2). It is an \\nautoimmune disease with a familial component and is 5–10 \\ntimes more common in women, usually presenting between 30 \\nand 50 years of age. Other causes include toxic multinodular \\ngoitre, solitary toxic nodule, thyroiditis and excessive thyroid \\nhormone ingestion.\\nHypothyroidism is caused by reduced levels of thyroid \\nhormones, usually due to autoimmune Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, \\nand affects women approximately six times more commonly \\nthan men. Most other causes are iatrogenic and include previous \\nradioiodine therapy or surgery for Graves’ disease.\\nThe history\\nCommon presenting symptoms\\nNeck swelling\\nGoitre is enlargement of the thyroid gland (Fig. 10.3).

Graves’ \\nophthalmopathy is characteristically associated with \\nrestriction of upgaze.\\nLid retraction (a staring appearance due to widening of the \\npalpebral fissure) and lid lag (see earlier) are common eye signs \\nassociated with hyperthyroidism.

In Graves’ disease the surface of the thyroid is \\nusually smooth and diffuse; in uninodular or multinodular goitre \\nit is irregular (see Fig. 10.3). Diffuse tenderness is typical of \\nviral thyroiditis. Localised tenderness may follow bleeding into a \\nthyroid cyst. Fixation of the thyroid to surrounding structures (such \\nthat it does not move on swallowing) and associated cervical \\nlymphadenopathy increase the likelihood of thyroid malignancy. \\nFurther investigation of thyroid disorders is summarised in  \\nBox 10.3.\\nEyes\\nExamination sequence\\n• Look for periorbital puffiness or oedema, and lid  \\nretraction (this is present if the white sclera is visible  \\nabove the iris in the primary position of gaze; see  \\nFig. 10.2A).\\n• Examine for features of Graves’ ophthalmopathy, including \\nexophthalmos (look down from above and behind the \\npatient), lid swelling or erythema, and conjunctival redness \\nor swelling (chemosis).\\n•\\n Assess for lid lag: ask the patient to follow your index \\nfinger as you move it from the upper to the lower part of \\nthe visual field. Lid lag means delay between the \\nmovement of the eyeball and descent of the upper eyelid, \\nexposing the sclera above the iris.\\n10.3 Investigations in thyroid disease\\nInvestigation Indication/comment\\nBiochemistry\\nThyroid function tests To assess thyroid status\\nImmunology\\nAntithyroid peroxidase antibodies Non-specific, high in autoimmune \\nthyroid disease\\nAntithyroid stimulating hormone \\nreceptor antibodies\\nSpecific for Graves’ disease\\nImaging\\nUltrasound Goitre, nodule\\nThyroid scintigraphy (\\n123I, 99mTc) To assess areas of hyper-/\\nhypoactivity\\nComputed tomography To assess goitre size and aid \\nsurgical planning\\nInvasive/other\\nFine-needle aspiration cytology Thyroid nodule\\nRespiratory flow-volume loops To assess tracheal compression \\nfrom a large goitre\\nTHE PARATHYROIDS\\nAnatomy and physiology\\nThere are usually four parathyroid glands situated posterior to \\nthe thyroid (see Fig. 10.1A). Each is about the size of a pea \\nand produces parathyroid hormone, a peptide that increases \\ncirculating calcium levels.\\nThe history\\nCommon presenting symptoms\\nParathyroid disease is commonly asymptomatic. In hyperparathy-\\nroidism the most common symptoms relate to hypercalcaemia: \\npolyuria, polydipsia, renal stones, peptic ulceration, tender areas \\nof\\tbone\\tfracture\\tor\\tdeformity\\t(‘Brown\\ttumours’:\\tFig.\\t10.6A),\\t\\nand delirium or psychiatric symptoms. In hypoparathyroidism, \\nhypocalcaemia may cause hyper-reflexia or tetany (involuntary \\nmuscle contraction), most commonly in the hands or feet. \\nParaesthesiae of the hands and feet or around the mouth may \\noccur. Hypoparathyroidism is most often caused by inadvertent \\ndamage to the glands during thyroid surgery but may also be \\ncaused by autoimmune disease. Patients with the rare autosomal \\ndominant condition pseudohypoparathyroidism have end-organ \\nresistance to parathyroid hormone and typically have short stature, \\na round face and shortening of the fourth and fifth metacarpal \\nbones (Fig. 10.6B,C).'),\n",

Courtesy of  \\nDr Dilip Patel.\\nAnatomy and physiology\\nThe pituitary gland is enclosed in the sella turcica at the base of \\nthe skull beneath the hypothalamus. It is bridged over by a fold of \\ndura mater (diaphragma sellae) with the sphenoidal sinus below \\nand the optic chiasm above. Lateral to the pituitary fossa are the \\ncavernous sinuses, containing cranial nerves III, IV and VI and the \\ninternal carotid arteries. The gland comprises anterior and posterior \\nlobes. The anterior lobe secretes adrenocorticotrophic hormone \\n(ACTH), prolactin, growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating \\nhormone (TSH) and gonadotrophins (luteinising hormone (LH) \\nand follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)). The posterior lobe is \\nan extension of the hypothalamus, and secretes vasopressin \\n(antidiuretic hormone) and oxytocin.\\nThe history\\nCommon presenting symptoms\\nPituitary tumours are common and are found incidentally in around \\n10% of patients undergoing head computed tomography (CT) or \\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hypopituitarism can result \\nfrom a space-occupying lesion or from a destructive or infiltrative \\nprocess such as trauma, radiotherapy, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis \\nor metastatic disease. Pituitary infarction or haemorrhage can \\nresult in acute hypopituitarism (referred to as pituitary apoplexy) \\nand is a medical emergency; it is often associated with headache, \\nvomiting, visual impairment and altered consciousness.\\nNon-functioning pituitary adenomas may be asymptomatic \\nor may present with local effects, such as compression of the \\noptic chiasm causing visual loss (typically bitemporal upper \\nquadrantanopia or hemianopia; Fig. 10.8 and see Fig. 8.5)'),\n",

The openings of \\nthe lactiferous ducts are on the apex of the nipple, which is \\nerectile tissue. The nipple is in the fourth intercostal space in \\nthe mid-clavicular line, but accessory breast/nipple tissue may \\ndevelop anywhere down the nipple line (axilla to groin) (Figs 11.1 \\nand 11.2). The adult breast is divided into the nipple, the areola \\nand four quadrants (upper outer to lower inner), with an axillary tail \\n(of Spence) projecting from the upper outer quadrant (Fig. 11.3).\\nThe size and shape of the breasts are influenced by age, \\nhereditary factors, sexual maturity, phase of the menstrual cycle, \\nparity, pregnancy, lactation and nutritional state. Fat and stroma \\nsurrounding the glandular tissue determine the size of the breast, \\nexcept during lactation, when enlargement is mostly glandular. The \\nbreast responds to fluctuations in oestrogen and progesterone \\nlevels. Swelling and tenderness are common in the premenstrual \\nphase. The glandular tissue reduces and fat increases with age, \\nmaking the breasts softer and more pendulous. Lactating breasts \\nare swollen and engorged with milk, and are best examined \\nafter breastfeeding.\\nThe history\\nBenign and malignant conditions of the breast cause similar \\nsymptoms but benign changes are much more common. The \\nmost common presenting symptoms are a breast lump, breast \\npain, and skin and nipple changes. Men may present with \\ngynaecomastia (breast swelling). Women are often worried that \\nthey have breast cancer, whatever breast symptom they have, \\nand it is important to explore these concerns.\\nThe history of the presenting symptoms is crucial.

They \\nhave their own blood, lymphatic and nerve supply, so testicular \\nproblems may cause abdominal pain and enlargement of the \\npara-aortic lymph nodes. The scrotum is a pouch with thin, \\npigmented, wrinkled skin that helps to regulate the temperature \\nof the testes (Fig. 11.42), as sperm production is most efficient \\nbelow body temperature. The left testis lies lower than the right. \\nEach\\ttestis\\tis\\toval,\\t3.5–4\\tcm\\tlong\\tand\\tcovered\\tby\\tthe\\ttunica\\t\\nalbuginea, which forms the posterior wall of the tunica vaginalis. \\nThis is a prolongation of the peritoneal tube that forms as the \\ntestis\\tdescends\\tduring\\tdevelopment.\\tIf\\tit\\tpersists,\\tit\\tmay\\tbe\\t\\nassociated with an indirect inguinal hernia sac or a congenital \\nhydrocoele. Along the posterior border of each testis is the \\nepididymis.\\nThe testes produce sperm and testosterone, starting at \\npuberty (10–15 years of age; see Fig. 15.18). Sperm mature in \\nthe epididymis and pass down the vas deferens to the seminal \\nvesicles. They are ejaculated from the urethra, together with \\nprostatic and seminal vesicle fluid, at orgasm.\\nThe penis has two cylinders of endothelium-lined spaces \\nsurrounded by smooth muscle, the corpora cavernosa (Fig. \\n11.43). These are bound with the bulbospongiosus surrounding \\nthe urethra, which expands into the glans penis. The penile skin \\nis reflected over the glans, forming the prepuce (foreskin). Sexual \\narousal causes a parasympathetically mediated increased blood \\nflow into the corpora cavernosa with erection to enable vaginal \\npenetration. Continued stimulation causes sympathetic-mediated \\ncontraction of the seminal vesicles and prostate, closure of the \\nbladder neck and ejaculation. Following orgasm, reduction in \\nblood inflow causes detumescence.\\nThe prostate and seminal vesicles contribute to seminal fluid. \\nAfter age 40 the prostate develops a trilobar structure because of \\nbenign enlargement. Two lateral lobes and a variable median lobe \\nprotrude into the bladder and may cause urethral and bladder \\noutflow obstruction. Prostate cancer develops in the peripheral \\ntissue of the lateral lobes and sometimes may be detected by \\ndigital rectal examination. Only the posterior aspect and the lateral \\nlobes of the prostate can be felt by rectal examination (p. 111).\\nThe history\\nDisorders of the male genitals may present as urinary symptoms, \\ngenital or pelvic pain, genital swellings, sexual dysfunction or \\ninfertility.\\nIn\\taddition\\tto\\tdocumenting\\tthe\\tman’s\\tmain\\tgenital\\tor\\turinary\\t\\nproblems, be sure to ask about:\\n•\\t the\\ttimescale\\tof\\ttheir\\tdevelopment\\n•\\t how\\tthey\\taffect\\tlifestyle\\tand\\tany\\tsexual\\tactivity\\n•\\t sexual\\tfunction,\\tif\\tappropriate\\n•\\t past\\tconceptions\\tor\\tproblems\\twith\\tfertility\\n•\\t general\\turological\\tsymptoms:\\n• genital swelling\\n• genital or pelvic pain\\n• lower urinary tract symptoms\\n• urethral discharge.\\nThere may be associated systemic upset or clinical signs \\nassociated with urological disease; a full history and examination \\nare therefore important.'),\n",

Varies between 1.002 and 1.035. Raised when kidneys actively reabsorb water, e.g. in fluid \\ndepletion or renal failure due to decreased perfusion. Abnormally low values indicate failure to concentrate urine\\npH Normally 4.5–8.0. In renal tubular acidosis, pH never falls < 5.3 despite acidaemia\\nGlucose Small amounts may be excreted by normal kidneys. Glycosuria may indicate poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. It may occur in \\nintrinsic renal disease when tubular glucose reabsorption is impaired\\nKetones Test is specific for acetoacetate and does not detect other ketones, e.g. β-OH butyrate, acetone. Ketonuria occurs in diabetic \\nketoacidosis, starvation, alcohol use and very-low-carbohydrate diets\\nProtein Varies between trace and 4+. The greater the degree of proteinuria, the more likely there is to be significant renal disease. Most \\npatients with nephrotic syndrome will have 4+ protein. The presence of both blood (≥\\n 2+) and protein (≥  2+), an ‘active urinary \\nsediment’, often indicates intrinsic renal disease. As urinalysis is semiquantitative, confirmatory laboratory quantification should be \\nundertaken using either a urine albumin  : creatinine or protein : creatinine ratio (see Box 12.4)\\nBlood ≥1+ is positive for non-visible haematuria. The test does not differentiate between haemoglobin and myoglobin. If you suspect \\nrhabdomyolysis, measure myoglobin with a specific laboratory test\\nBilirubin and \\nurobilinogen\\nBilirubin is not normally present. Urobilinogen may be up to 33  µmol/L in health. Abnormalities of bilirubin and urobilinogen \\nrequire investigation for possible haemolysis or hepatobiliary disease\\nLeucocyte \\nesterase\\nIndicates the presence of neutrophils in urine. Seen in urinary tract infection or inflammation, stone disease and urothelial cancers\\nNitrite Most Gram-negative bacteria convert urinary nitrate to nitrite. A positive result indicates bacteriuria but a negative result does not \\nexclude its presence\\n12.6 Functional assessment of the lower urinary tract\\nFrequency/volume chart\\n• Chart is used to monitor micturition patterns, including nocturia, and fluid intake\\n• The patient collects their urine, measures each void, and charts it against time over 3–5 days\\nUrine flow rate\\n•\\n The patient voids into a special receptacle that measures the rate of urine passage\\n• A low flow does not differentiate between poor detrusor contractility and bladder outlet obstruction\\nUrodynamic tests\\n•\\n Invasive tests, necessitating the insertion of bladder and rectal catheters to measure total bladder pressure and abdominal pressure, and to allow \\nbladder filling\\n• Filling studies determine detrusor activity and compliance\\n• Low detrusor pressures with low urine flow suggest detrusor function problems\\n• High detrusor pressures with low flow suggest bladder outlet obstruction\\nInvestigation of renal function\\nFunctional\\tstudies\\tmay\\tbe\\tuseful\\tin\\tpatients\\twith\\tvoiding\\tsymptoms\\t\\n(Box\\t12.6).\\tIn\\taddition\\tto\\turinalysis,\\tthere\\tare\\ta\\tnumber\\tof\\tother\\t\\nblood\\tand\\turine\\ttests\\t(Box\\t12.7),\\tas\\twell\\tas\\timaging\\tstudies\\t\\n(Box\\t12.8),\\tthat\\tmay\\thelp\\tin\\tthe\\tassessment\\tof\\tthe\\tpatient\\twith\\t\\nrenal\\tdisease.\\nthe\\tassessment\\tof\\trenal\\tdisease.\\tThe\\tkey\\telements\\tare\\tdescribed\\t\\nin\\tBox\\t12.5.\\nNormal\\tfresh\\turine\\tis\\tclear\\tbut\\tvaries\\tin\\tcolour.\\tCloudy\\tfresh\\t\\nurine\\tis\\tusually\\tdue\\tto\\tthe\\tpresence\\tof\\tleucocytes\\t(pyuria).\\t\\nDiscoloration\\tof\\tthe\\turine\\tcan\\toccur\\tdue\\tto\\tdrugs\\t(such\\tas\\t\\nrifampicin),\\tfoods\\t(beetroot)\\tor\\tmetabolites\\t(bilirubin).\\tStrong\\t\\nodours\\tcan\\tbe\\tdue\\tto\\tinfections;\\tsome\\tfoods,\\tlike\\tasparagus,\\t\\nimpart\\ta\\tcharacteristic\\tsmell\\tto\\tthe\\turine.'),\n",

If intermittent, with resolution \\nbetween episodes, it may be palindromic rheumatism.\\nExacerbating/relieving factors\\nPain from joints damaged by intra-articular derangement or \\nosteoarthritic degeneration worsens with exercise. Pain from \\ninflammatory arthritis worsens with rest. Pain from a septic joint \\nis present both at rest and with movement.\\nSeverity\\nApart from trauma, the most severe joint pain occurs in septic \\nand crystal arthritis. Disproportionately severe pain is seen \\nacutely in compartment syndrome (increased pressure in a \\nfascial compartment, compromising perfusion and viability of \\ncompartmental structures) and chronically in complex regional \\npain syndrome. Neurological involvement in diabetes mellitus, \\nleprosy (Hansen’s disease), syringomyelia and syphilis (tabes \\ndorsalis) may impair joint sensation, reducing pain despite obvious \\npathology on examination. Grossly abnormal joints may even \\nbe pain-free (Charcot joints). Partial muscle tears are painful; \\ncomplete rupture may be less so.\\nPatterns of joint involvement\\nDifferent patterns of joint involvement aid the differential diagnosis \\n(Fig. 13.3). Are the small or large joints of the arms or legs \\naffected? How many joints are involved? Involvement of one \\njoint is called a monoarthritis; 2–4 joints, oligoarthritis; and more \\nthan 4, polyarthritis.\\n•\\t Predominant\\tinvolvement\\tof\\tthe\\tsmall\\tjoints\\tof\\tthe\\thands\\t\\nand feet suggests an inflammatory arthritis, such as \\nrheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\\narthritis can develop over 24 hours, or more insidiously. Crystal \\narthritis (gout and pseudogout) causes acute, severe pain that \\ndevelops quickly, often overnight. Joint sepsis causes pain that \\ndevelops over 1–2 days.\\nCharacter\\nBone pain is penetrating, deep or boring, and is characteristically \\nworse at night. Localised pain suggests tumour, osteomyelitis \\n(infection), osteonecrosis or osteoid osteoma (a benign bone \\ntumour). Generalised bony conditions, such as osteomalacia, \\nusually cause diffuse pain.\\nFracture pain is sharp and stabbing, aggravated by attempted \\nmovement, and relieved by rest and splintage.\\nMuscle pain is often described as ‘stiffness’ or aching, and \\nis aggravated by use of the affected muscle(s).\\n‘Shooting’ pain is often caused by impingement of a peripheral \\nnerve or nerve root: for example, buttock pain, which ‘shoots \\ndown the back of the leg’, caused by lumbar disc protrusion.\\nProgressive joint pain in patients over 40 years of age is \\ncommonly caused by osteoarthritis.\\nFibromyalgia, a chronic pain syndrome, causes widespread, \\nconstant pain with little diurnal variation, which is poorly controlled \\nby conventional analgesic/anti-inflammatory drugs.\\nRadiation\\nPain from nerve compression radiates to the distribution of \\nthat nerve or nerve root (see Fig. 7.23), such as lower leg pain \\nin intervertebral disc prolapse, or hand pain in carpal tunnel \\nsyndrome. Neck pain radiates to the shoulder or scalp. Hip pain \\nis usually felt in the groin but may radiate to the thigh or knee. \\nCommon patterns of radiation are summarised in Box 13.3.\\nAssociated symptoms\\nFor example, swelling and redness of a joint indicate inflammatory \\narthritis.\\nTiming (frequency, duration and  \\nperiodicity of symptoms)\\nA history of several years of pain with a normal examination \\nsuggests fibromyalgia (Box 13.4).

Pain in a lower \\nlimb is usually aggravated by weight bearing, so minimal time \\nis spent in the stance phase on that side. This results in a \\n‘dot–dash’ mode of walking. If the source of pain is in the spine, \\naxial rotatory movements are minimised, resulting in a slow gait \\nwith small paces. Patients with hip pain may lean towards the \\naffected side, as this decreases the compression force on the  \\nhip joint.\\nStructural change\\nPatients with limb-length discrepancy may limp or walk on tiptoe \\non the shorter side, with compensatory hip and knee flexion on \\nthe longer side. Assess for limb-length discrepancy (see Fig. \\n13.36). Other structural changes producing an abnormal gait \\ninclude joint fusion, bone malunion and contracture.\\nWeakness\\nThis may be due to nerve or muscle pathology or altered muscle \\ntone. In a normal gait the hip abductors of the stance leg raise \\nthe contralateral hemipelvis. In Trendelenburg gait, abductor \\nfunction is poor when weight-bearing on the affected side, so \\nthe contralateral hemipelvis falls (see Fig. 13.37).\\nCommon causes of a Trendelenburg gait are:\\n•\\t painful\\thip\\tjoint\\tproblems,\\tas\\tin\\tosteoarthritis\\n•\\t weak\\thip\\tabductors,\\tas\\tin\\tpoliomyelitis\\tor\\tafter\\thip\\t\\nreplacement\\n•\\t structural\\thip\\tjoint\\tproblems,\\tas\\tin\\tcongenital\\tdislocation.\\nA high-stepping gait occurs in foot drop due to common \\nperoneal nerve palsy. The knee is raised high to allow clearance \\nof the weak foot.\\nIncreased tone\\nThis occurs with upper motor neurone lesions, such as \\ncerebrovascular accident (stroke) or cerebral palsy. The gait \\ndepends on the specific lesion, contractures and compensatory \\nmechanisms (see Fig. 7.17).\\nSpine\\nThe spine is divided into the cervical, thoracic, lumbar and \\nsacral segments (Fig. 13.11). Most spinal diseases affect \\nmultiple segments, causing altered posture or function of the \\nwhole spine. Spinal disease may occur without local symptoms, \\npresenting with referred pain, neurological symptoms or signs in \\nthe trunk or limbs. Common causes of spinal pain are shown in  \\nBox 13.9.\\nDefinitions\\nScoliosis is lateral curvature of the spine (Fig. 13.12A).\\nKyphosis is curvature of the spine in the sagittal (anterior–\\nposterior) plane, with the apex posterior (Fig. 13.12B). The thoracic \\nspine normally has a mild kyphosis.\\nLordosis is curvature of the spine in the sagittal plane, with \\nthe apex anterior (Fig. 13.12C).\\nGibbus is a spinal deformity caused by an anterior wedge \\ndeformity of a single vertebra, producing localised angular flexion \\n(Fig. 13.12D).\\n• Stand behind the patient, hold their pelvis, and ask them \\nto turn from side to side without moving their feet.\\n• Ask them to slide their hand down the lateral aspect of \\ntheir leg towards their knee.\\n• Stand in front of the patient. Ask them to put their ear to \\neach shoulder in turn.\\n• Ask the patient to look down to the floor and then up to \\nthe ceiling.\\n• Ask them to open their jaw wide and move it from side  \\nto side.\\nHypermobility\\nSome patients have a greater than normal range of joint movement. \\nIf this is severe, patients may present with recurrent dislocations \\nor sensations of instability. Milder cases may develop arthralgia \\nor be symptom-free. Mild hypermobility is normal but Marfan’s, \\nEhlers–Danlos and benign joint hypermobility syndromes (Box \\n13.8) cause significant hypermobility.\\nDetailed examination of the \\nmusculoskeletal system\\nThe GALS screen provides a rapid but limited assessment. This \\nsection describes the detailed examination required for thorough \\nevaluation.\\nGait\\nGait is the cyclical pattern of musculoskeletal motion that carries \\nthe body forwards. Normal gait is smooth, symmetrical and \\nergonomically economical, with each leg 50% out of phase with \\nthe other. It has two phases: stance and swing.

Symptoms are worse in the morning or after inactivity, \\nand ease with movement. Morning stiffness is more marked \\nthan in osteoarthritis, lasting at least 30 minutes. Other clues \\nto the diagnosis are peripheral joint involvement, extra-articular \\nfeatures or a positive family history.\\nAcute onset of low back pain in a young adult, often associated \\nwith bending or lifting, is typical of acute disc protrusion (slipped \\ndisc). Coughing or straining to open the bowels exacerbates the \\npain. There may be symptoms of lumbar or sacral nerve root \\ncompression. Cauda equina syndrome occurs when a central disc \\nprolapse, or other space-occupying lesion, compresses the cauda \\nequina. There are features of sensory and motor disturbance, \\nincluding diminished perianal sensation and bladder function \\ndisturbance. The motor disturbance may be profound, as in \\nparaplegia. Cauda equina syndrome and spinal cord compression \\nare neurosurgical emergencies.\\nThe principal movements are flexion, extension, lateral flexion \\nand rotation. In flexion, the upper segments move first, followed \\nby the lower segments, to produce a smooth lumbar curve. \\nHowever, even with a rigid lumbar spine, patients may be able \\nto touch their toes if their hips are mobile.\\nIn the adult, the spinal cord ends at L2. Below this, only the \\nspinal nerve roots may be injured by disc protrusion.\\nThe history\\nLow back pain is extremely common.

Movement also \\noccurs between the scapula and the chest wall. The rotator \\ncuff muscles are supraspinatus, subscapularis, teres minor and \\ninfraspinatus. They and their tendinous insertions help stability \\nand movement, especially abduction at the glenohumeral joint.\\nThe history\\nPain is common (Boxes 13.15 and 13.16) and frequently referred \\nto the upper arm. Glenohumeral pain may occur over the \\nanterolateral aspect of the upper arm. Pain felt at the shoulder \\nmay be referred from the cervical spine or diaphragmatic \\nand subdiaphragmatic peritoneum via the phrenic nerve. The \\nmost common cause of referred pain is cervical spondylosis, \\nwhere disc-space narrowing and osteophytes cause nerve root \\nimpingement and inflammation.\\n• Radial nerve (wrist and finger extensors): ask the patient to \\nextend the wrist and fingers fully (‘paper sign’).\\n• Ulnar nerve (hypothenar muscles, interossei, two medial \\nlumbricals, adductor pollicis, flexor carpi ulnaris and the \\nulnar half of flexor digitorum profundus): ask the patient to \\nmake the ‘scissors sign’.\\n•\\n Median nerve (thenar muscles that abduct and oppose the \\nthumb, the lateral two lumbricals, the medial half of flexor \\ndigitorum profundus, flexor digitorum superficialis, flexor \\ncarpi radialis, palmaris longus and pronator teres): ask the \\npatient to clench the fist fully (‘stone sign’). The best test \\nof median nerve motor function is the ability to abduct the \\nthumb away from the palm because of inconstant \\ncrossover in the nerve supply to the thenar eminence \\nmuscles other than abductor pollicis brevis.

The medial and lateral epicondyles are \\nthe flexor and extensor origins, respectively, for the forearm \\nmuscles. These two prominences and the tip of the olecranon \\nare easily palpated. They form an equilateral triangle when \\nthe elbow is flexed to 90 degrees, and lie in a straight line \\nwhen the elbow is fully extended. A subcutaneous bursa \\noverlies the olecranon and may become inflamed or infected \\n(bursitis). Elbow pain may be localised or referred from the \\nneck. Inflammatory arthritis and epicondylitis commonly cause  \\nelbow pain.\\nThe physical examination\\nExamination sequence\\nLook\\n• Look at the overall alignment of the extended elbow.

An effusion indicates intra-articular pathology. \\nHaemarthrosis (bleeding into the knee) is caused by injury to a \\nvascular structure within the joint, such as a torn cruciate ligament \\nor an intra-articular fracture. The menisci are predominantly \\navascular and do not cause a haemarthrosis, unless torn at their \\nperiphery, or in conjunction with some other internal derangement.\\nLocking\\nTwo common causes in the knee are a loose body, such \\nas from osteochondritis dissecans, osteoarthritis or synovial \\nchondromatosis, and a meniscal tear. Bucket-handle and anterior \\nbeak meniscal tears are especially associated with locking. \\nPosterior horn tears commonly cause pain and limit movement \\nin the last few degrees of flexion. Meniscal tears also cause local \\njoint-line tenderness. Congenital discoid meniscus may present \\nwith locking and clunking.\\nInstability (‘giving way’)\\nAny of the four main ligaments may rupture from trauma or \\nbecome incompetent with degenerative disease.

This allows dorsiflexion and plantar flexion, although \\nAnterior cruciate ligament\\nExamination sequence\\nAnterior drawer test\\n• Flex the patient’s knee to 90 degrees and maintain  \\nthis position using your thigh to immobilise the  \\npatient’s foot.\\n• Check that the hamstring muscles are relaxed and look for \\nposterior sag (posterior subluxation of the tibia on the \\nfemur). This causes a false-positive anterior drawer sign \\nthat should not be interpreted as ACL laxity.\\n•\\n\\t With\\tyour\\thands\\tbehind\\tthe\\tupper\\ttibia\\tand\\tboth\\t \\nthumbs over the tibial tuberosity, pull the tibia anteriorly \\n(Fig. 13.41B). Significant movement (compared with the \\nopposite knee) indicates that the ACL is lax. Movement of \\n>\\n 1.5 cm suggests ACL rupture. There is often an \\nassociated medial ligament injury.\\nLachmann test\\n• Flex the knee at 20–30 degrees with the patient supine. \\nPlace one hand behind the tibia and grasp the patient’s \\nthigh with your other hand. Pull the tibia forward to assess \\nthe amount of anterior motion of the tibia in comparison to \\nthe femur. An intact ACL should prevent forward \\ntranslational movement (‘firm endpoint’), while a deficient \\nACL will allow increased forward translation without a \\ndecisive ‘endpoint’.\\nPosterior drawer test\\n• Push backwards on the tibia. Posterior movement  \\nof the tibia suggests posterior cruciate ligament  \\nlaxity.\\nTests for meniscal tears\\nMeniscal tears in younger, sporty patients usually result from a \\ntwisting injury to the weight-bearing leg. In middle-aged patients, \\ndegenerative, horizontal cleavage of the menisci is common, with \\nno history of trauma. Meniscal injuries commonly cause effusions, \\nespecially on weight bearing or after exercise. Associated joint-line \\ntenderness is common.\\nA simple test for a meniscal tear is to extend the patient’s \\nknee rapidly from 30 degrees flexion to full extension. If the \\npatient experiences medial or lateral pain, this suggests a tear, \\nand formal testing should take place.\\nAB\\nFig. 13.41 Testing the ligaments of the knee.  A  Collateral ligaments.

The safety of the patient, \\nother patients and staff is paramount, so your initial assessment \\nof an agitated or hostile patient may be only partial.\\nThe mental state examination\\nThe mental state examination (MSE) is a systematic evaluation \\nof the patient’s mental condition at the time of interview. The \\naim is to establish signs of mental disorder that, taken with the \\nhistory, enable you to make, suggest or exclude a diagnosis. \\nWhile making your specific enquiries, you need to observe, \\nevaluate and draw inferences in the light of the history. This is \\ndaunting, but with good teaching, practice and experience you \\nwill learn the skills.\\nThe MSE incorporates elements of the history, observation \\nof the patient, specific questions exploring various mental \\nphenomena and short tests of cognitive function. Like the history, \\nits focus is determined by the potential diagnoses. For example, \\ndetailed cognitive assessment in an elderly patient presenting \\nwith confusion is crucial; similarly, you should carefully evaluate \\nmood and suicidal thoughts when the presenting problem is \\ndepression.\\nAppearance\\nThink of this as a written account of a still photograph, prepared \\nfor someone who cannot see it.

Psychiatric \\nassessment is therefore a required skill for all clinicians. It consists \\nof four elements: the history, mental state examination, selective \\nphysical examination and collateral information. Each element can \\nbe expanded considerably, so the assessment must be adapted \\nto its purpose. Is it a quick screening of a patient presenting \\nwith other problems, a confirmation of a suspected diagnosis \\nor a comprehensive review for a second opinion?\\nThe history\\nGeneral approach\\nThe distinction between symptoms and signs is less clear in \\npsychiatry than in the rest of medicine. The psychiatric interview, \\nwhich covers both, has several purposes: to obtain a history of \\nsymptoms, to assess the present mental state for signs, and to \\nestablish rapport that will facilitate further management.\\nA comprehensive history covers a range of areas (Box 16.1), but \\nthe nature of the presenting problem and/or the referral question, \\nand the setting in which the history is being taken, will determine \\nthe degree of detail needed for each. When seeing someone in \\nthe accident and emergency department with a first episode of \\npsychosis, the focus is on symptoms, recent changes of function, \\nfamily history and drug use; when interviewing someone in an \\noutpatient clinic with a possible personality disorder, assessment \\nconcentrates instead on their personal history, which is essentially \\na systematised biography (Box 16.2).\\nSensitive topics\\nSome\\tsubjects\\trequire\\tparticular\\tskill.\\tThe\\tcommon\\ttheme\\tis\\t\\nreluctance to disclose, which can arise because the information \\nis private, and disclosure is potentially embarrassing (such as \\nsexual\\tdysfunction,\\tgender\\tidentity),\\tdistressing\\t(major\\ttraumatic\\t\\nexperiences, such as rape, childhood sexual abuse, witnessing a \\n16.1 Content of a psychiatric history\\n• Referral source\\n• Reason for referral\\n• History of presenting symptom(s)\\n• Systematic enquiry into other relevant problems and symptoms\\n• Past medical/psychiatric history\\n• Prescribed and non-prescribed medication\\n• Substance use: illegal drugs, alcohol, tobacco, caffeine\\n• Family history (including psychiatric disorders)\\n• Personal history\\n16.2 Personal history\\n• Childhood development\\n• Losses and experiences\\n• Education\\n• Occupation(s)\\n• Financial circumstances\\n• Relationships\\n• Partner(s) and children\\n• Housing\\n• Leisure activities\\n• Hobbies and interests\\n• Forensic history'),\n",

The most common are auditory and visual hallucinations, \\nthe former associated with schizophrenia and the latter with \\ndelirium. Some auditory hallucinations are characteristic of \\nschizophrenia, such as voices discussing the patient in the \\nthird person or giving a running commentary on the person’s \\nactivities (‘Now he’s opening the kitchen cupboard’). Ask, for \\nexample, ‘Do you ever hear voices when nobody is talking?’ \\nand ‘What do they say?’\\nPseudohallucinations are common. The key distinction from \\na true hallucination is that they occur within the patient, rather \\nthan arising externally. They have an ‘as if’ quality and lack the \\nvividness and reality of true hallucinations. Consequently, the \\naffected person is not usually distressed by them, and does \\nnot normally feel the need to respond, as often happens with \\ntrue hallucinations.\\nCognition\\nIf the history and observation suggest a cognitive deficit, it must \\nbe evaluated by standard tests. History, observation, MSE and \\nrating scales (see later) are then used together to diagnose and \\ndistinguish between the ‘3Ds’ (dementia, delirium and depression), \\nwhich are common in the elderly and in hospital inpatients.\\nCore cognitive functions include:\\n•\\t level\\tof\\tconsciousness\\n•\\t orientation\\n•\\t memory\\n•\\t attention\\tand\\tconcentration\\n•\\t intelligence.\\nLevel of consciousness\\nMental disorders are rarely associated with a reduced (or clouded) \\nlevel of consciousness, such as drowsiness, stupor or coma. \\nThe exception is delirium (which is both a physical and a mental \\ndisorder), where it is common.\\nOrientation\\nThis is a key aspect of cognitive function, being particularly \\nsensitive to impairment. Disorientation is the hallmark of \\nthe ‘organic mental state’ found in delirium and dementia. \\nAbnormalities may be evident during the interview but some \\npatients are adept at hiding them in social interactions. Check \\nthe patient’s orientation to time, place and person by evaluating \\ntheir knowledge of the current time and date, recognition of \\nwhere they are, and identification of familiar people.\\nMemory\\nMemory function is divided into three elements:\\n•\\t Registration\\tis\\ttested\\tby\\tasking\\tthe\\tpatient\\tto\\trepeat\\tafter\\t\\nyou\\tthe\\tnames\\tof\\tthree\\tunrelated\\tobjects\\t(apple,\\ttable,\\t\\npenny); any mistake is significant.

They \\ninclude a delusional perception (or primary delusion) and ‘passivity \\nphenomena’: namely, the belief that thoughts, feelings or acts \\nare no longer controlled by a person’s own free will.\\nPerceptions\\nPeople normally distinguish between their inner and outer worlds \\nwith ease: we know what is real, what reality feels like, and what \\nresides in our ‘mind’s eye’ or ‘mind’s ear’. In mental illness this \\ndistinction can become disrupted, so that normal perceptions \\nbecome unfamiliar, while abnormal perceptions seem real.\\nAbnormal perceptions are assessed via the history and specific \\nenquiries, backed up by observation. They fall into several \\ncategories, defined in Box 16.9.\\nPerceptions may be altered (as in sensory distortions or illusions) \\nor false (as in hallucinations and pseudohallucinations). In a third \\ncategory, what is altered is not a perception in a specific sensory \\nmodality but a general sense of disconnection and unreality \\nin oneself (depersonalisation), the world (derealisation) or both.\\nPeople find depersonalisation and derealisation intensely \\nunpleasant but hard to describe. They may occur in association \\nwith severe tiredness or intense anxiety but can also arise in most \\ntypes of mental illness.

Sometimes the \\nrisk applies non-specifically to strangers, or to anyone preventing \\nthe patient from achieving their goals.\\nThere may be direct risk to life and limb (as in suicide, self-harm \\nor violence to others), or it may be an indirect risk, either to health \\n(through refusal of treatment for physical or mental illness) or \\nwelfare (through inability to provide basic care – food, warmth, \\nshelter, hygiene – for oneself or one’s dependents). The risk may \\nbe imminent, as in a patient actively attempting self-harm, or \\nremote, as in a patient refusing prophylactic medical treatment. \\nDirect risks tend to be imminent and indirect risks remote, although \\nthis is not always so. A patient declining renal dialysis because \\ntheir depression makes them feel unworthy is at imminent but \\nindirect risk of death. Finally, the likelihood of the risk may range \\nfrom near certainty to hypothetical possibility.\\nA risk assessment should readily distinguish between cases \\nwhere there is an imminent, direct and near-certain risk to the \\npatient’s life (such as a man actively trying to throw himself from \\nthe window to escape delusional persecutors), and those where \\nany risks apply to the welfare of other people, at some point \\nin the future, and amount to possibilities (such as a depressed \\nwoman who may be neglecting her frail elderly father). The former \\ncase calls for urgent intervention, probably via mental health \\nlegislation; the latter requires engagement over time, preferably \\nin a voluntary way.\\nWhile all psychiatric evaluations require some assessment of \\nrisk, it should be considered in depth whenever the presentation \\nincludes acts or threats of self-harm or reports of command \\nhallucinations, the past history includes self-harm or violent \\nbehaviour, the social circumstances show a recent, significant \\nloss, or the mental disorder is strongly associated with risk (as \\nin severe depression).\\nAssessing suicidality is the element of risk assessment that is \\nmost often needed. If a patient presents after an act of self-harm \\nor overdose, the questions arise naturally (‘What did you want \\nto happen when you took the tablets? Did you expect to die? \\nIs that what you wanted? How do you feel about that now? Do \\nyou still feel you’d be better off dead? Have you had thoughts \\nabout doing anything else to harm yourself?’).\\nIn\\tother\\tcircumstances\\tthe\\tsubject\\twill\\tneed\\tto\\tbe\\tintroduced,\\t\\nbut do not fear that you may be putting ideas in the patient’s \\nmind (‘You’ve told me how bad you have been feeling. Have \\nyou ever felt life is not worth living? Have you had any thoughts \\nabout ending your life? How close have you come? What has \\nstopped you acting on those thoughts so far?’).\\nCapacity\\nAssessing capacity is a skill required of all doctors and should not \\nbe delegated to psychiatrists. The legal elements vary between \\njurisdictions\\tbut\\tthere\\tare\\tkey\\tclinical\\tprinciples\\tin\\tcommon.\\t\\nThe first is the presumption of capacity : clinicians should treat \\npatients as retaining capacity until it is proven that they have lost \\nit. Secondly, capacity is decision-specific: patients may not be \\nable to understand the risks and benefits of complex medical \\ntreatment options, while retaining the ability to decide whether \\nor not to enter a nursing home. Thirdly, residual capacity should \\nbe maximised: if a patient’s ability to understand is impaired by \\nsensory deficits or language barriers, these should be corrected \\nnew information; once this has registered, check retention \\nafter 5 minutes, with a distracting task in between. Do the \\nsame\\twith\\tthe\\tnames\\tof\\tthree\\tobjects;\\tany\\terror\\tis\\t\\nsignificant. Alternatively, use a six-item name and address \\n(in the format: Mr David Green, 25 Sharp Street, Durham). \\nMore than one error indicates impairment.\\n•\\t Long-term\\tmemory\\tis\\tassessed\\tmainly\\tfrom\\tthe\\tpersonal\\t\\nhistory. Gaps and mistakes are often obvious but some \\npatients may confabulate (that is, fill in the gaps with \\nplausible but unconsciously fabricated facts), so check the \\naccount with a family member or other informant if \\npossible. Confabulation is a core feature of Korsakoff’s \\nsyndrome, a complication of chronic alcoholism. Failing \\nlong-term memory is characteristic of dementia, although \\nthis store of knowledge can be remarkably intact in the \\npresence of severe impairment of other cognitive functions.\\nImpaired attention and concentration\\nThese occur in many mental disorders and are not diagnostic. \\nImpaired attention is observed as increased distractibility, with \\nthe patient responding inappropriately to intrusive internal events \\n(memories, obsessions, anxious ruminations) or to extraneous \\nstimuli, which may be either real (a noise outside the room) or \\nunreal (auditory hallucinations).\\nConcentration is the patient’s ability to persist with a mental \\ntask. It is tested by using simple, repetitive sequences, such as \\nasking the patient to repeat the months of the year or days of \\nthe week in reverse, or to do the ‘serial 7s’ test, in which 7 is \\nsubtracted from 100, then from 93, then 86 and so on. Note \\nthe finishing point, the number of errors and the time taken.\\nIntelligence\\nThis is estimated clinically from a combination of the history \\nof educational attainment and occupations, and the evidence \\nprovided at interview of vocabulary, general knowledge, abstract \\nthought, foresight and understanding. If in doubt as to whether \\nthe patient has a learning disability, or if there is a discrepancy \\nbetween the history and presentation, a psychologist should \\nformally test IQ.\\nInsight\\nInsight is the degree to which a patient agrees that they are \\nill. It can be broken down into the recognition that abnormal \\nmental experiences are in fact abnormal, agreement that these \\nabnormalities amount to a mental illness, and acceptance of the \\nneed for treatment. Insight matters, since a lack of it often leads \\nto non-adherence, and sometimes to the need for compulsory \\ndetention. You might ask ‘Do you think anything is wrong with \\nyou’ or ‘If you are ill, what do you think needs to happen to \\nmake you better?’\\nRisk assessment\\nRisk assessment is a crucial part of every psychiatric assessment. \\nConsider:\\n•\\t Who\\tis\\tat\\trisk?\\n•\\t What\\tis\\tthe\\tnature\\tof\\tthe\\trisk?\\n•\\t What\\tis\\tthe\\tlikelihood\\tof\\tthe\\trisk?\\nThe person usually at risk, if anyone, is the patient themselves. \\nThe risk posed to others by people with mental disorder must'),\n",

The key principles here are to ensure that any treatment \\nproposed must benefit the patient and be the least restrictive \\noption available; it should take account of any wishes the patient \\nhas previously expressed, as well as the views of family members \\nand any other relevant others (such as nursing home staff).\\nThe physical examination\\nPhysical and mental disorders are associated, so always consider \\nthe physical dimension in any patient presenting with a psychiatric \\ndisorder, and vice versa. The setting and the patient’s age, health \\nand mode of presentation will determine the extent of physical \\nassessment required.\\nIn psychiatric settings, general physical observation, coupled \\nwith basic cardiovascular and neurological examination, will usually \\nsuffice. Bear in mind that some physical disorders can present \\nwith psychiatric symptoms (such as thyrotoxicosis manifesting \\nas anxiety – look for exophthalmos, lid lag, goitre, tachycardia \\nand so on). For older patients with multiple medical problems, or \\nthose with alcohol dependence and associated physical harm, \\na more detailed examination is clearly needed.\\nIn primary care and acute hospital settings, patients will \\nusually undergo physical examination tailored to the presenting \\nproblem, but it is important to be aware that some psychiatric \\ndisorders can present with physical symptoms, such as chest \\npain and transient neurological symptoms as manifestations of \\npanic attacks.\\nCollateral history\\nCollateral history is important whenever assessment is limited by:\\n•\\t physical\\tillness,\\tacute\\tconfusional\\tstate\\tor\\tdementia\\n•\\t severe\\tlearning\\tdisability\\tor\\tother\\tmental\\tdisorder\\timpairing\\t\\ncommunication\\n•\\t disturbed,\\taggressive\\tor\\totherwise\\tuncooperative\\t\\nbehaviour.\\nSources of third-party information will usually include family and \\nother carers, as well as past and present general practitioners \\nand other health professionals.

Other \\nproblems, including impaired hearing, low mood or dysphasia, \\ncan mimic cognitive impairment. Some patients present with \\napparently good social skills or ‘façade’ and cover their impaired \\nmemory by diverting the conversation to another topic. Do not \\nascribe changes in cognition to age alone without excluding \\ndementia or delirium (p. 323).\\nDepression is common in frail elderly people and may be \\ndifficult to diagnose. Consider this if your patient struggles to \\nconcentrate, or is withdrawn or reluctant to interact. A formal \\npsychiatric assessment and corroborating history from a carer or \\nfriend may be valuable. Standardised rating scales are available \\nsuch as the Geriatric Depression Scale.\\nPatients are often fearful that they will be admitted to hospital \\nor not return home after admission, and may play down their \\nsymptoms or functional limitations. Always try to corroborate the \\nhistory from a carer, relative or friend, with the patient’s consent.\\nThe history\\nThe presenting symptoms\\nFrail elderly patients often have multiple symptoms. Take time \\nto detail each symptom, and separate those arising from new \\nacute illness from those due to background disabilities.\\nAsk:\\n•\\t How\\tlong\\thave\\tyou\\thad\\ta\\tparticular\\tsymptom?\\n•\\t Has\\tit\\tchanged\\trecently?\\n•\\t When\\twere\\tyou\\tlast\\ttotally\\tfree\\tof\\tthe\\tsymptom?\\nTry to establish what the patient’s symptoms, functional abilities \\nand mental status were before the new presenting problem. This \\nhelps set realistic goals for treatment and rehabilitation.\\nThe patient’s perspective may vary from yours, particularly \\nin acute settings. For example, a patient referred following \\nsudden loss of consciousness may be unconcerned by this \\nbut anxious about longstanding back pain. These symptoms \\nare not coincidental; if it is important to your patient, it should \\nbe important to you.\\nCommon presenting symptoms\\nDecreased mobility\\nAsk about:\\n•\\t the\\tpatient’s\\tusual\\tmobility,\\twhen\\tit\\tchanged\\tand\\tif\\tthe\\t\\nchange was abrupt\\n•\\t any\\tfalls\\n•\\t use\\tof\\twalking\\taids\\n•\\t history\\tof\\trecent\\thead\\tinjury,\\tfevers\\tor\\trigors,\\tdizziness\\tor\\t\\npoor balance\\n•\\t lower\\tlimb\\tweakness,\\tnumbness\\tor\\tparaesthesia\\n•\\t joint\\tpain,\\tespecially\\tin\\tthe\\tback,\\tneck\\tor\\tlower\\tlimbs'),\n",

This can occur at any stage of a patient’s \\nillness but is more common if the patient has been admitted \\nas an emergency, undergone surgery or spent time in a \\nhigh-dependency or intensive care setting. Common causes \\nfor deterioration include sepsis, bleeding, myocardial infarction, \\nhypoglycaemia and pulmonary embolism.\\nEarly assessment and intervention is required, as these patients \\nare at high risk of cardiac arrest; once this occurs, fewer than \\n20% of patients survive to hospital discharge.\\nVital signs\\nPhysiological observations are monitored routinely in patients who \\nare admitted to hospital. The vital signs that are measured include \\nheart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturations, \\ntemperature and level of consciousness. Additional monitoring \\nmay include urine output, pain assessment and blood glucose  \\ntesting.\\nEarly warning scores\\nVital signs are recorded using track-and-trigger systems in the \\nform of early warning scores designed to assess illness severity. \\nMeasurements are made of the patient’s respiratory rate, the \\nuse of oxygen therapy, oxygen saturation, temperature, heart \\nrate, blood pressure and level of consciousness, and points \\nare assigned for physiological derangement in each organ \\nsystem. Increased frequency of observations is recommended \\nfor patients with abnormal signs, and a rising score triggers a \\ngraded response.\\nIn the UK there is a validated track-and-trigger system, the \\nNational Early Warning Score (NEWS; Fig. 18.1). This system \\nwill trigger a graded response, due to either an aggregated high \\nscore or a single severe physiological derangement, with the \\nurgency and seniority of the team being summoned escalating \\nas the score rises (Box 18.1). For example, a NEWS score of \\nbetween 1 and 4 is escalated to the nurse in charge of the \\nward, a score of 5 or 6 (or a single observation scoring 3) is \\nescalated to the doctor covering the ward, and a score of 7 \\nshould be escalated to a senior doctor and discussed with the \\nsupervising consultant, with consideration of referral to a critical  \\ncare team.\\nThe early warning score is designed to complement clinical \\njudgement. If you or another member of your team is concerned \\nabout a patient, do not dismiss this instinct purely because \\nthe early warning score is low.

A brief muscle spasm may be observed at \\nthat time, so warn relatives about this.\\nConfirming and certifying death\\nThe confirmation and certification of death are important to allow \\nthe legal requirements and cultural and religious traditions that \\nhappen after a person has died to be fulfilled. Some people will \\nhave decided to be organ donors. Notification of the relevant \\nteam in advance and the prompt diagnosis of death can make \\nthis possible for many of them.\\nIn the UK death is defined as ‘the irreversible loss of the essential \\ncharacteristics necessary to the existence of a living person – to \\nbe able to sense and interact with the environment and to maintain \\nthe fundamental bodily functions of respiration and circulation’.\\nConsciousness and respiratory and circulatory function are \\ncontrolled within the brainstem. Irreversible damage to the \\nbrainstem, either after cardiorespiratory arrest or due to direct \\ndamage to the brainstem itself, always results in death.\\nThe history\\nA decision will usually have been made and documented in \\nadvance, stating that CPR will not be given because it would \\nnot work or would have a very poor outcome for this person. \\nOccasionally, a person with one or more advanced illnesses \\ndeteriorates more rapidly than expected or a decision that CPR will \\nnot be given has not been made in advance. In those situations \\nthe professionals who are present decide if CPR should not start \\nor should be stopped.\\nIf you are not familiar with the patient and their recent medical \\nhistory, read their records before going to see them or speaking \\nto their family. Being aware of whether the death was sudden or \\nexpected and how the person has been during their final illness \\nhelps you to prepare for speaking with the family.\\nThe physical examination\\nAfter the person has died, it is important for the clinical team to \\ncontinue to care for them as they would any other patient. This \\nincludes speaking about the person by name to family members \\nwho are present at the time of death or while you are carrying \\nout the examination to confirm death. Some relatives choose \\nto remain in the room and you need to explain each part of the \\nexamination in simple terms and conduct it in a respectful and \\nprofessional manner.\\nThe person who has died should be observed for a minimum \\nof 5 minutes to establish that irreversible cardiorespiratory arrest \\nhas occurred. This provides an opportunity for you to spend \\ntime supporting and listening to any family members who are \\npresent. After death the body cools gradually and stiffens; bowel \\nsounds may persist for a time until the sphincters relax and the \\nbowels and bladder empty.\\nBrainstem death\\nThe diagnosis of brainstem death must be made by at least two \\ndoctors who have been fully registered for at least 5 years.

It is important to review a patient who is \\ndying at least daily, and more often if they are unsettled or have \\ncomplex clinical problems. If a patient deteriorates rapidly or their \\nsymptoms change, urgent assessment is required.

Modern assessment \\nmethods such as OSCEs and clinical simulation allow assessment \\nof knowledge, skills and attitudes in an integrated manner and can \\npermit candidates to demonstrate a higher level of performance \\nthrough ‘showing how’ and ‘doing’ (Fig. 20.1).\\nAssessments are linked to the learning outcomes of a course or \\ncurriculum, and ‘blueprinting’ is used to ensure there is appropriate \\ncoverage of the required knowledge, skills and behaviours across \\nthe examination. In order to perform well in clinical assessments, \\nit is therefore crucial that you familiarise yourself with both the \\ncurriculum and the domains or skills on which you are being \\nassessed. Not all skills will be assessed at each examination \\n(Box 20.2).\\nOnce you have achieved a level of competence in a clinical \\nskill or domain, you may be considered to be ‘entrustable’ in this \\nprofessional activity. For example, a final-year medical student \\nmay be ‘entrusted’ to perform peripheral cannulation on a patient \\nif they have demonstrated competence in the specified domains \\n(such as obtaining consent from a patient for the procedure and \\ntechnical competence in the procedure itself).\\nGeneral principles\\nClinical assessments are integral to undergraduate and \\npostgraduate medical education and training, and are designed \\nto verify that those involved in the care of patients meet safe \\nclinical standards. Assessments can be formative and/or \\nsummative. Formative assessments (such as workplace-based \\nassessments) allow you to receive feedback on and monitor your \\nown performance. Assessments such as these can be highly \\neffective adjuncts to learning if they promote reflection on your \\nown performance and recognition of areas for improvement \\nand further development. Summative assessments, on the \\nother hand, are used to evaluate whether you have achieved a \\nrequired competence or standard in terms of knowledge, skills \\nor performance, which may be set by licensing bodies such as \\nthe General Medical Council in the UK or postgraduate colleges. \\nAssessment can also be used to provide evidence of safe practice: \\nfor example, simulation assessments for doctors in difficulty, or \\nfor recruitment and selection into specialty training.\\nThis chapter provides an overview of the spectrum of clinical \\nassessment methods, with a particular emphasis on objective \\nstructured clinical examinations (OSCEs) and clinical simulation \\nscenarios.

Experiential learning such as this (‘learning by doing’) also \\nsupports the transition from theory to practice. Clinical simulation \\nis commonly included in both undergraduate and postgraduate \\nassessments to evaluate a candidate’s ability to integrate a \\nnumber of complex skills or domains, which may include clinical \\nexamination, practical skills and drug or fluid prescribing. Often the \\nscenario will involve an acutely unwell patient who is experiencing \\na medical emergency such as life-threatening asthma, where \\nthe use of a real patient is not feasible (Box 20.3). The patient \\nmannequin is set up in a realistic clinical environment (such as \\na simulated ward), with real props and equipment (such as a \\nnebuliser mask), and there is often an additional member of staff \\nin the room (playing the role of the nurse, for example) who can \\nperform tasks and provide results of investigations if requested \\nby the candidate. Sometimes a facilitator may also be the \\n‘voice’ of the patient, giving important prompts (‘I can’t breathe’ \\nor simulating audible wheeze). The examination brief will clarify \\nwhat is expected of you during the station but it is likely that you \\nwill be assessed on your competence in physical assessment, \\ncommunication skills and the initial management of the patient.\\nOSCEs\\nThese are widely used in undergraduate and postgraduate assess-\\nments, and are commonly designed to assess communication/\\nconsultation skills, practical skills, examination skills or an inte -\\ngrated combination of all of these. OSCEs consist of multiple \\nclinical encounters or ‘stations’ (generally between 6 and 12). \\nCandidates rotate through each station, which will be assigned \\na fixed duration (usually 8–12 minutes).\\nOSCEs may use a combination of real patients with good \\nclinical signs, simulated patients who often participate in the \\ncommunication skills stations, simulation mannequins (who may \\nbe put in the role of an acutely unwell patient where using a real \\npatient is not feasible or safe) and/or part-task trainers (lifelike \\nmodels of body parts) for assessment of procedural skills such \\nas venepuncture (Box 20.4).\\nMarking structures\\nExaminers award marks for your performance in assessments \\nusing a standardised marking structure.

These checklists \\nare commonly used in OSCE stations, where the assessment \\nis broken down into its individual components (for example, \\n‘Introduces self to patient’), each component is allocated a \\nrange of marks, and your score is calculated as the sum of \\nthe component marks (Box 20.4). Often a significant number \\nof marks will be allocated to generic aspects of the encounter \\n(such as hand washing, obtaining consent to proceed, and \\ndemonstrating kindness and respect). There may also be some \\nelements of the OSCE that are mandatory in order to achieve \\na pass (such as administering oxygen to a simulated patient \\nwith acute asthma, or addressing the patient’s concerns in a \\ncommunications station). By familiarising yourself with the marking \\nstructure for the examination, you can ensure that you tailor your \\npreparation to maximise your chance of success.\\nAnother common examination marking approach is the use \\nof global judgement scores. Global judgements are awarded \\nas an overall rating of performance or competence in particular \\ndomains or distinct observed behaviours (such as ‘Identifying \\nclinical signs’ or ‘Maintaining patient welfare’, see Box 20.3). \\nWhen global assessment is used, usually two or more examiners \\nwill independently mark the candidate. If the assessment has \\nincluded a simulated or real patient, they may also be asked for \\ntheir global judgement of your performance.\\nApproach to preparation\\nMake sure that you start to prepare well in advance and familiarise \\nyourself with the format of the assessment: know how many \\nstations there are, how long you have for each station and what \\ndomains or skills are being assessed. Most institutions will readily \\ntell you what is expected from a candidate in order to pass each \\nstation, and there may be useful information available online. For \\nexample, to achieve a pass in a physical examination OSCE you \\nmay be required to perform a systematic examination, correctly \\nidentify the physical signs, create a sensible differential diagnosis \\nand suggest an appropriate initial management plan. Remember \\nthat assessments are ‘blueprinted’ (that is, they will be mapped \\nto the learning outcomes from your curriculum; Box 20.2) and \\nyou should therefore use the curriculum to guide your learning.\\nTo some extent, the cases you are likely to be presented with \\nin an examination can be predicted. Institutions will typically \\nhave a cohort of volunteer patients with common chronic stable \\ndiseases (such as pulmonary fibrosis or a renal transplant) or \\npathognomonic signs (retinitis pigmentosa or acromegaly), who \\nhave volunteered to participate. These patients may have helped \\nin examinations before and will be well prepared to cooperate \\nwith your physical assessment. It is unusual to be asked to \\nexamine a patient who is acutely unwell, and therefore conditions \\nsuch as severe asthma or pulmonary oedema will usually be \\ntested only in simulated scenarios. Remember that there are \\ncertain rare conditions, many of which are covered in earlier \\nsections of this book, that may be over-represented in certain \\nexaminations. Where possible, speak to other candidates who \\nhave sat the examination in the past, or refer to past papers or \\nrevision aids where they exist.\\nTake every opportunity you can to practise what will be expected \\nof you on the day, informally with peers or more formally in \\npreparatory courses if these are available to you.

If you are going \\nto have physical contact with a patient during the assessment, \\nalways clean your hands with alcohol-based gel or soap and water \\n(see Fig. 3.1) and observe basic safety principles, including the \\nuse of personal protective equipment and safe sharps disposal.\\nManaging time\\nManaging your time, both in advance of and during the \\nassessment, can have a major impact on your performance. \\nMake sure that you know where the examination is to be held, \\nrehearse your journey and give yourself plenty of time to get  \\nthere.\\nPay particular attention to the timings within the examination \\nand ensure that you have practised completing your assessment \\nwithin the allocated time. Some assessments will be broken into \\ndifferent stages, and it is worth finding out as much as you can \\nabout the format; you may think you have 10 minutes to complete \\nthe OSCE station but in reality you may be allowed to spend only \\npart of the time with the patient with the remaining time reserved \\nfor questioning from the examiners. Marks will be awarded for \\nyour answers to these questions. If you take too long assessing \\nthe patient, you may not be able to take advantage of these \\nmarks; similarly, if you finish your assessment too quickly, you \\nrisk the examiners moving on to more challenging questions to \\nfill the remaining time. Assessments will often have short breaks \\nbetween stations to allow candidates to read the instructions for \\nthe next station; once again, it is helpful to familiarise yourself \\nwith these aspects of the examination in advance.\\nCommunication during assessment\\nIt is vital in any assessment that you communicate with the \\nexaminers and patients in a polite and professional manner, as \\nyou would in real clinical practice. Always obtain consent from \\nthe patient to be examined, be sure not to cause any physical \\ndiscomfort and thank them at the end of the station. Examiners \\nwill be assessing your communication skills and bedside manner, \\nas well as your clinical examination technique.\\nListen carefully to the instructions from the examiners, as these \\nare often very specific (‘Examine this patient’s precordium’). You \\nmay also be told whether you should present your findings as \\nyou go along or at the end of your examination. When presenting \\nyour clinical findings, try to sound confident about them, avoid \\nusing language that indicates uncertainty in your own abilities (‘I \\nthink I heard a systolic murmur’ does not fill an examiner with \\nconfidence) and never report findings that you have not actually \\nelicited. Use a succinct and structured format when presenting, \\nhighlighting important positive findings and describing only the \\nrelevant negative findings (see Box 20.5); listing all negatives \\nwastes valuable time. If there is an obvious abnormality (such \\nas a patient who is jaundiced), it is sensible to mention this early \\nin your case presentation so that examiners see that you have \\nnoted the important finding. Do not expect any feedback from your \\nexaminers at the end of each station, as generally they are asked \\nto avoid giving you an indication of how you have performed.\\nIn communication stations involving simulated patients, you \\nmay be asked to take a focused history or to discuss a specific \\nissue such as consent, or to break some difficult news.

Sometimes doctors instantly recognise \\na condition based on previous experience (‘spot diagnoses’, \\np. 34). Visual patterns are particularly likely to lead to such \\nrecognition: for example, a typical rash. More commonly, elements \\nof the history and examination together trigger pattern recognition. \\nThis process relies on comparing a patient’s presentation to cases \\nencountered before and remembered as ‘illness scripts’. With \\nincreasing experience, less typical presentations are encountered \\nand recalled, and doctors are increasingly able to recognise \\nmore exceptional cases.\\nPre-test probability\\nWhere doctors are unable to recognise patterns in presentations \\nquickly, various refinement strategies are used to arrange the \\npossible diagnoses in order of probability. The pre-test probability \\nof a disease in an individual depends on the context in which \\nthe symptom has appeared because the prevalence of disease \\nvaries between populations. In general practice populations the \\nincidence of serious disease is much lower than in hospital \\npopulations; serious conditions still usually need to be excluded, \\nhowever. This may involve identification of ‘red flag’ symptoms \\nand signs for serious disease, or the use of clinical prediction \\nrules such as the Wells score for deep vein thrombosis. Positive \\n‘red flag’ features or above-threshold prediction scores increase \\nthe probability of a disease in individuals and generally trigger \\nfurther investigations.\\nAdditional factors affecting the pre-test probability of disease in \\npatients with the same presenting symptoms include age, gender, \\npast medical history, family history and lifestyle. Few doctors use \\nformal probabilistic reasoning in making diagnoses, but most \\nknow the relationship between these factors and the likelihood \\nof a specific disease and use this understanding intuitively to \\nselect likely diagnoses (hypotheticodeductive reasoning, Fig. \\n21.1). History, examination and investigation results are used \\nto support or refute putative diagnoses. These components are \\nrarely independent, however, and returning to clarify the history \\nor re-examine when signs are ambiguous allows an iterative \\napproach to accurate diagnosis.\\nRare diseases\\nWhile diagnosis by probability works in most cases, rare diseases \\nalso occur, and to the affected patients and their families they are \\nnot rare. Avoid the trap of thinking that all patients have common \\nconditions and that symptoms that do not fit with common \\ndiagnoses are less important. Indeed, occasional patients with \\na credible and consistent history of unusual symptoms may actually \\nmerit more, not less, investigation. The art is to listen carefully, \\nkeep an open mind, and pick up the uncommon situation when the \\nusual patterns of presentation really do not fit the facts of a case.\\nOther factors that complicate the application of clinical skills \\nin diagnosis include:\\n•\\t clinical\\tproblems\\tinvolving\\tmany\\torgan\\tsystems\\trather\\t \\nthan one\\n•\\t new\\tdisease\\toccurring\\tin\\tthe\\tcontext\\tof\\texisting\\tphysical\\t\\nand psychological comorbidities\\nThe transition from medical student to junior doctor culminates in \\nindependent practice in a variety of clinical settings. This chapter \\naddresses how the clinical skills described in this book are used \\nand adapted in everyday practice.\\nWhatever the setting, the doctor’s task is to translate \\npatients’ problems into diagnoses, therapeutic possibilities and \\nprognoses. Undergraduate medical students first learn history \\ntaking, examination and investigation as a logical sequence, \\nas described in preceding chapters. In reality, however, the \\napplication of these skills to a patient’s clinical problem is often \\na less ordered, more nuanced process.\\nAdapting history and examination \\nskills appropriately\\nHistory and examination skills are adapted by doctors to suit the \\nsituation. For example, elective surgical or unscheduled emergency \\nadmissions may require a systematic and comprehensive history \\nand examination. Patients attending a specialist outpatient clinic, \\nwill already have been screened by a referring clinician, however, \\nand a history and examination focused on the presenting condition \\nis appropriate. If the patient is attending a review clinic, history and \\nexamination may be restricted to monitoring an existing condition. \\nThe information-gathering process may appear to be sequential: \\nthe history suggests a differential diagnosis; examination and \\nthen investigation help confirm or refute diagnostic possibilities. \\nIn reality, these elements often occur in parallel. For example, \\nsequential history then examination may be abandoned in \\nfavour of a more opportunistic approach to avoid distressing \\na reluctant child. In critically ill patients a highly focused history \\nand examination aimed at rapidly identifying the main problems \\nwhile initiating resuscitation is imperative.\\nIntegrated examination\\nAlthough in an individual it is rarely necessary to carry out a \\ncomprehensive history and examination of all systems, a rapid \\nscreening examination may be useful to direct more detailed \\nexamination if the diagnosis is unclear or when patients are \\nbeing admitted to hospital. There is no single correct procedure \\nfor performing a physical examination and you will develop your \\nown approach, but a reasonable routine is outlined in Box 21.1.\\n21.1 A personal system for performing a  \\nphysical examination\\n• Handshake and introduction\\n• Note general appearances \\nwhile talking:\\n• Does the patient look well?\\n• Any immediate and obvious \\nclues, e.g. obesity, \\nplethora, breathlessness\\n•\\n Complexion\\n• Hands and radial pulse\\n• Face\\n• Mouth and ears\\n• Neck\\n• Thorax:\\n• Breasts\\n• Heart\\n• Lungs\\n• Abdomen\\n• Lower limbs:\\n• Oedema\\n• Circulation\\n• Locomotor function and \\nneurology\\n• Upper limbs:\\n• Movement and neurology\\n• Cranial nerves, including \\nfundoscopy\\n• Blood pressure\\n• Temperature\\n• Height and weight\\n• Urinalysis'),\n",

This helps patients to feel that they are being \\ntaken seriously; in addition, organic disease, however unlikely, \\nis less likely to be missed.\\nPatients’ illness beliefs matter hugely and should be explicitly \\nacknowledged. What do they think is wrong?

Symptoms are not synonymous with disease, however, \\nbut are subjective experiences with many possible sources: \\npathological, physiological, psychological, cultural, behavioural \\nand external. Many patients experience symptoms that impair \\nfunction but do not fit characteristic patterns of disease, and \\npersist despite normal examination and investigations. These are \\ncalled ‘functional’ or ‘medically unexplained symptoms’ (MUS, Fig. \\n21.2). Over 30% of patients attending their general practitioner \\nhave MUS and they are also common in secondary care, although \\ndisease prevalence is much higher there. Some symptoms are \\nmore likely to be medically unexplained than others: for example, \\npersistent fatigue, abdominal pain and back pain. The causes \\nof MUS are poorly understood but various predisposing and \\nprecipitating factors (Box 21.2) may contribute. Most functional \\nsymptoms are transient but some become persistent, causing \\nsimilar disability to those resulting from disease and also significant \\nemotional distress. If MUS are not recognised and managed \\nappropriately, attempts to alleviate them can result in harm from \\nfruitless investigations, inappropriate interventions or drugs, and \\nincreased fear of disease.\\nPatients with MUS commonly feel that doctors do not think \\ntheir symptoms are real, leading to a breakdown in trust between \\npatient and doctor, and frustration for both. Crucially, doctors \\nmust use an empathic and non-judgemental approach so the \\npatient feels believed. Keep an open mind and accept all the'),\n",

Examination and interventions often \\noccur simultaneously as the clinician attempts to identify the \\nmain problems. Initially, your aim is to gain control of the situation \\nand stabilise the patient’s condition. A fuller history and clinical \\nexamination can follow after initial resuscitation.\\nThe approach to recognising and assessing the acutely ill and \\ndeteriorating patient is covered in detail in Chapter 18.\\nDocumenting your findings\\nDocumenting clinical findings in a clear and concise medical \\nrecord is a crucial aspect of medical practice. It should include \\na structured account of the history and examination – both \\npositive and important negative findings. Some circumstances \\ndemand additional detail: for example, forensic documentation \\nof the length and position of wounds.\\nThe appropriate level of detail varies with the context but adopt \\nand use a consistent format. This format quickly becomes a habit, \\nreduces your need to think about what to record next, and lessens \\nthe likelihood of forgetting something important. A consistent \\nformat also allows others to locate specific information quickly \\nin your documentation. An example of clear and comprehensive \\nclinical documentation of a case is shown in Fig. 21.3.\\nOne widely used overall structure for organising your written \\ndocumentation is SOAP, an acronym for subjective, objective, \\nassessment and plan.\\nSubjective\\nThis records information you obtain directly from the patient (or \\nsomeone speaking on their behalf). It constitutes the body of \\nthe history, as covered in Chapter 2. What is the patient’s chief \\nsymptom? What is the patient’s current condition? It is best \\nto avoid describing the problem in medical terms at this point \\nand more useful to record the patient’s own words. What is the \\nhistory of the problem? If an injury, what was the mechanism?\\nPast medical history, family medical history, social history \\n(including smoking and alcohol or recreational drug use), current \\nmedications and any allergies should also be noted here.\\nObjective\\nThis is information you gather about the patient. Here you record \\nvital signs, findings from your physical examination and the results \\nof any initial investigations. Again, it is useful to use a standard \\nformat to record physical findings, so others can find specific \\ninformation quickly.\\nAssessment\\nThis starts with a brief summary of the information obtained. It \\nthen lists the patient’s main symptoms, together with a differential \\ndiagnosis. If the patient has several pressing issues, compile a \\n‘problem list’. Not all of these problems may be medical but they \\nwill all influence the best plan for what to do next. For example, \\n‘worsening soft-tissue infection of the left lower leg’ is a problem \\nwith a diagnosis, but ‘not taken any of the prescribed antibiotics \\nbut some non-pathological signs are associated with MUS; for \\ninstance, in irritable bowel syndrome you may find evidence of \\nbloating and some tenderness, but otherwise gastrointestinal \\nexamination will be normal. The history often suggests MUS, so \\nfocus on excluding any unexpected physical findings, as well as \\ndemonstrating to patients that you are taking them seriously. Any \\nsigns you do find may vary between examinations but overall \\nthe examination is commonly normal with MUS.\\nInvestigations are used in MUS mainly to reassure both \\nphysician and patient. Exhaustive investigations to exclude all \\nphysical illness are costly and unhelpful, risk side effects and \\ndo not reassure patients in the longer term. Before requesting \\ninvestigations, discuss with the patient the likelihood and \\nsignificance of a normal result. Patients are more likely to be \\nsatisfied when your explanation makes sense to them, removes \\nblame and helps generate ideas about how they can manage \\ntheir symptoms.\\nAssessment of a patient with minor \\ninjury or illness\\nIn patients with minor injury or illness, usually presenting in the \\naccident and emergency department or general practice, a history \\nand examination focused on the presenting symptoms are usually \\nsufficient. It is, however, crucial to establish the reason for the \\npatient’s presentation, as well as clearly defining their clinical \\nproblem, as their concerns about their symptoms and their \\nexpectations of investigation and treatment influence the outcome.\\nCarefully eliciting the mechanism of injury, progression of \\nsymptoms and their impact on the patient (for example, whether \\nthey can walk and go to work/school) will help detect problems \\nthat are not as ‘minor’ as they might seem. Be wary of the \\napparently minor injury or illness that is actually the tip of a \\ndiagnostic iceberg, for example:\\n•\\t a\\tclavicular\\tfracture\\tcaused\\tby\\tminimal\\ttrauma,\\twhich\\tis\\tin\\t\\nfact a pathological fracture secondary to an underlying \\nlung malignancy\\n•\\t a\\tfall\\twith\\twrist\\tinjury\\tthat\\twas\\tactually\\ta\\tsyncopal\\tepisode\\t\\ncaused by cardiac arrhythmia\\n•\\t shoulder\\tpain\\tthat\\tinitially\\tsounds\\tmusculoskeletal\\tbut\\tis\\tin\\t\\nfact the first presentation of angina\\n•\\t a\\tpattern\\tof\\tsoft-tissue\\tinjury\\tin\\ta\\ttoddler\\tthat\\tis\\tcompletely\\t\\nat odds with the history, suggesting possible \\nnon-accidental injury.\\nFocus your examination on the system or body part implicated \\nin the history, as outlined in previous chapters. If the findings \\nare not consistent, carry out a more comprehensive history and \\nexamination. If the system affected is unclear (such as arm pain, \\nwhich may be musculoskeletal, vascular, neurological or referred \\ncardiac pain), examine all of these systems.\\nAs you formulate a differential diagnosis, check for other \\nsystemic features of disease in addition to examining the \\nobvious source of symptoms. A swollen ankle may trigger a \\nsystematic enquiry and examination if the history suggests a \\nreactive arthropathy rather than a simple sprain.\\nFocusing the clinical examination comes with practice, but \\nif in doubt, be comprehensive. Start with the body part that \\nis causing the most trouble and follow leads. Elements of the \\nexamination likely to cause discomfort should be left until last.\\nA careful and courteous examination can also increase trust \\nbetween the patient and clinician. Even when you feel it is unlikely \\nto yield important information, examination reassures the patient'),\n",

By using this method \\nyou are proactively giving the listener the information that they \\nwould be requesting anyway to assess the problem. You save time \\nby assimilating and presenting information in a structured way.\\nWritten communication\\nConventionally, information was transferred between doctors \\nby post, but increasingly communication is done electronically. \\nWhatever the medium, the quality of written communication is \\ncrucial. Handwritten forms must be clear and legible. Doctors \\nshould write clear, well-structured referral, discharge or transfer \\nletters (see Boxes 21.3 and 21.4). More and more, these letters \\nare copied to, or read by, patients as well as other clinicians, so \\nthey must always contain appropriate language.\\nClinical information is confidential and sensitive. It should never \\nbe transmitted by insecure electronic means. Nor should it be \\nstored on, or copied to, equipment that could be stolen or lost, \\nbreaching confidentiality. Encryption should be used wherever \\npossible to protect electronic records, and all clinical information \\nshould always be managed in accordance with local information \\ngovernance regulations.\\n•\\t Background: the information needed to make an \\nassessment:\\n•\\n Relevant history: what were the key events leading up \\nto the present situation?\\n• Vital signs.\\n– ‘Mr Jackson had a sudden onset of severe \\nheadache after waking at about 07:00 this  \\nmorning. The pain hasn’t improved despite \\npainkillers and he appears to be getting  \\nworse. He’s hypertensive at 210/110 and  \\nvomiting.’\\n•\\t\\nassessment: what is your assessment of the  \\nproblem?\\n– ‘I’m concerned that Mr Jackson may be having an \\nintracranial bleed.’\\n•\\t recommendation/request: what do you think should be \\ndone? What assistance are you asking for? Be clear about \\nwhat you need and when you need it.\\n– ‘I’d like you to come and review the patient urgently \\nplease.’\\nIf you are feeling out of your depth and need support from a \\nsenior colleague, be clear about that. It is better to endure the \\nbrief discomfort of having to admit that you need help than to \\nput a patient’s wellbeing in jeopardy.'),\n",
